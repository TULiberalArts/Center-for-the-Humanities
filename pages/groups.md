## Inter-Disciplinary Research Groups
**_Due May 6, 2019_**

Interdisciplinary Research Groups help Temple faculty and graduate students from different departments, schools, and colleges to pursue shared research interests as well as participate in consortia with faculty from other universities. Proposals that engage emerging fields of inquiry and/or are linked to an interdisciplinary agenda are encouraged. Successful proposals are awarded between $500 and $1,500 for use during the academic year of award, depending on the size of the group and the research agenda. Unused funds will revert back to CHAT by June 30th. Groups receive priority access to CHAT facilities for meetings and lectures.

Groups will meet regularly throughout the year. Funds can be used to support meeting costs, publicity, books, visiting speakers, and related expenses. Membership is open to all, including students and faculty outside of Temple. Groups must have at least two organizers from different departments and a minimum of four members from within Temple University. Group funding seeds new and vital research activity and helps support ongoing programs. Groups may apply for funding renewal every year. A report of past year's activities is due to the Director of CHAT by **May 15th.**

## Co-Sponsorship Guidelines
Although CHAT dedicates most of its resources to programs that it initiates, it reserves some funds for proposals it receives from individuals, departments, or colleges within the Temple community. We encourage interdisciplinary proposals and proposals that have pledges of support from more than one department or program, including participation from units outside the College of Liberal Arts. CHAT will consider providing grants of $100 to $200 to supplement other funding for such proposals.

To apply, please send a description of the project explaining the rationale for your proposal, focusing on how you see this presentation/conference/activity contributing to humanistic research and study at Temple and appealing to diverse disciplines. Also please include a list of the sponsoring organization(s) or department(s), the invited participants, if applicable, the intended audience, the proposed date(s) of the program, publicity plans, the amount requested with a short budget, and what other sources of funding you expect or have requested.

There is no deadline for Co-Sponsorship requests. New applications are evaluated on a rolling schedule. Applications may be transmitted electronically or in print. Forward requests to [chat@temple.edu](mailto:chat@temple.edu).

Please direct any questions to Proessor Petra Goedde, CHAT Director, [pgoedde@temple.edu](mailto:pgoedde@temple.edu), [215-204-9206](tel:2152049206).
