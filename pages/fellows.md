![Tania Jenkins]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized2_tania_jenkins.jpg){:.responsive-img .img-right}
**_Tania Jenkins, Assistant Professor, Sociology_**<br>
As a CHAT fellow, I will spend the year writing my book, _Doctors' Orders: The Making of Status and Inequality in the American Medical Profession_ (under contract with Columbia University Press). This ethnography examines the construction and implications of status inequalities among internal medicine residents. I explore how American-trained MDs come to enjoy higher status in the profession compared to international or osteopathic graduates, who disproportionately occupy less prestigious positions. I conclude that by relying on informal status distinctions that equate status with merit, and eclipse structural disadvantages, US-trained physicians are able to remain elite despite importing some of the world's best and brightest.

### College of Liberal Arts Advanced Graduate Students

![Paige Gibson]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resizedGibsonP.jpg){:.responsive-img .img-right}
**_Paige Gibson, PhD Candidate, Klein College of Media and Communication_**<br>

Paige Gibson is a doctoral candidate in the Klein College of Media and Communication working at the intersection of social memory, technology, identity, and space/place. How does a city remember itself? And with what politics? Funded by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), Paige conducted ten months of fieldwork in Berlin, Munich, and Dresden to carry out a multi-sited analysis of German memory cultures. Uniting memory studies and science, technology and society studies, her dissertation examines place-based memory technologies used by institutional and vernacular actors to construct urban memoryscapes. Through this examination, she illustrates how different forms shape memory construction.

___

![Moonyoung Hwang]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized Moonyoung Hwang.jpg){:.responsive-img .img-right}
**_Moonyoung Hwang, PhD Candidate, Philosophy_**<br>

In my project, I argue that values (evaluative properties and terms) are importantly related to emotions. However, I reject the classical non-cognitivism, according to which emotions have nothing to refer to beyond themselves and are merely subjective. I claim that emotions, like belief, detect objective properties in the world. The objective properties tracked by emotions, I argue, are various relational properties between the agent and her environment regarding the agent's well-being.

___

![Nicole Nathan]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized NathanN.png){:.responsive-img .img-right}
**_Nicole Nathan, PhD Candidate, Anthropology_**<br>

Nicole Nathan is a doctoral candidate in the Department of Anthropology. Rooted in 12 months of ethnographic research, Nicole's dissertation, _"Gifts from God: Religion, Economic Relations, and Gift Giving during Short-Term Missions_", examines the dynamics of philanthropic relations expressed through religious proselytization and economic outreach during contemporary Evangelical youth mission trips in the Dominican Republic. She argues that by exposing youths to a social and cultural experience radically different from their own, mission trips have the potential to powerfully shape youths' worldviews, including how they conceptualize globalization and racial and economic inequality in ways that influence future economic behaviors.

___

![Elizabeth White Vidarte]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized Elizabeth White Vidarte.jpg){:.responsive-img .img-right}
**_Elizabeth White Vidarte, PhD Candidate, English_**<br>

Elizabeth is an English PhD candidate specializing in American literature and disability studies. She focuses on the cultural history of empathy and care for the mentally disabled from the late 19th century through the Great Depression. Investigating dependency relations in reciprocal and oppressive modes, she hopes to show that mind-related disability was often framed as a problem because it threatens to reveal raced and gendered autonomy as fictive fantasies of American identity. Yet despite this, it could also be framed as an imperative for ethical and reciprocal care that offered generative means for valuing difference. Elizabeth is also a currently participating in the Digital Scholars program, with plans to use textual analysis tools on her archival research.

___

### Graduate Associate Fellows
![James Kopaczewski]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized James Kopaczewski.jpg){:.responsive-img .img-right}
**_James Kopaczewski, PhD Candidate, History_**<br>

James Kopaczewski is a doctoral candidate in the Department of History at Temple University. A historian of the nineteenth-century United States, his dissertation explores Native American understandings of the American Civil War Era. For most of the nineteenth-century, violence, removal, and incarceration were the primary tools utilized by the federal government to pacify native resistance. His dissertation argues that native peoples viewed the war as an opportunity to potentially undercut this system and secure a greater degree of sovereignty. Similarly, the federal government reexamined its posture towards native peoples as a result of their mutual engagements in the Civil War Era.

___

![Elizabeth Bergman]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized Elizabeth Bergman.jpg){:.responsive-img .img-right}
**_Elizabeth Bergman, PhD Candidate, Dance_**<br>

Elizabeth June Bergman is a doctoral candidate and University Fellow in the Dance Department. Her dissertation, _Behind the Scenes and Across Screens: Michael Jackson and His Dancing Chorus_, focuses on the dancing labor of Jackson, his choreographic collaborators, and backup dancers; how television and video technology affected the transmission and transformation of dances; and Jackson and his chorus's influence on the development of the commercial dance industry in Los Angeles. Her research highlights the cultural histories of "street" and "studio" dance forms featured in music videos, the commercial imperatives of the entertainment industry, and the racial politics of the 1980s.

___

![Rebecca Croog]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized Rebecca Croog.jpg){:.responsive-img .img-right}
**_Rebecca Croog, PhD Candidate, Geography_**<br>

I became interested in pursuing a graduate degree in geography after conducting my own research as an undergraduate in Bolivia and Cuba. My curiosity about the intersection of agriculture and social change took me to quinoa growing communities in the Andean high plateau and to urban farms in Havana. Motivated by these projects and new questions that emerged out of them, I began participating in and researching urban agriculture back in the United States, first in Baltimore and then in Philadelphia when I joined Temple's GUS program. My doctoral research builds upon these experiences, looking at the historical geography of agriculture in Philadelphia and identifying the historical antecedents to current justice-related initiatives within the contemporary urban agriculture movement.

___

### Digital Humanities Scholars
![Yang Shan Chou]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized ChouY.jpg){:.responsive-img .img-right}
**_Yang Shan Chou_**<br>

My idea is to create an art project using physical computing, such as Arduino's, to explore the idea of the uncanny valley. The "uncanny valley" is defined as a phenomenon that occurs when a humanoid object resembles a human being, causing an unsettling effect for the viewers. Our experimental process will determine the form that the Uncanny Valley phenomenon will take in our project. This project will be split into three parts: 1) starting the experiment, 2) forming it into a story, and 3) finally, creating an interactive display that will enable us to make modifications based on the audience's feedback.

___

![Mannah Duah]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized2 DuahM.png){:.responsive-img .img-left}
**_Mannah Duah, PhD Candidate, History_**<br>

Manna Duah uses data and network analysis to map eight incidents of mass political mobilizations among African students in US international education programs between 1960 and 1975.

___

![Urszula Pruchniewska]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized2 PruchniewskaU.jpg){:.responsive-img .img-right}
**_Urszula Pruchniewska, PhD Candidate, Media and Communications_**<br>

Urszula Pruchniewska's project examines the #metoo movement on Twitter, identifying and analyzing the tweets in the key moments of the movement using both an automated content analysis and critical discourse analysis.

___

![Jessica L. Sitek]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized SitekJ.jpg){:.responsive-img .img-right}
**_Jessica L. Sitek, PhD Candidate, Religion_**<br>

As a third year PhD student in the Department of Religion, participation in this year;s Digital Scholars program will serve as part of my dissertation work. The proposed project uses postwar chaplaincy materials (manuals, pamphlets, histories, etc.) to examine how normative definitions of religion are formed, and specifically how official definitions are formed and function in a society that supposedly maintains separation of Church and State. This project is meant to serve as a foundation for broader work that considers the institutionalization of the chaplaincy as a clinical role, and its implications for care delivery. 

___

![Vivien Wise]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized2 WiseV.jpg){:.responsive-img .img-left}
**_Vivien Wise, MFA, Fibers and Material Studies_**<br>

Vivien Wise combines mapping, data, and traditional craft, to create topographies that are based on a connection between land and body, relation to care, and connection to personal history.


___

### Fellows Seminar
All faculty and graduate students holding fellowships or associateships participate in a bi-weekly set of meetings to discuss the work-in-progress of the participants. Lunch is provided, and material is pre-circulated so that discussion focuses on responses to the work.

Because participants come from a wide variety of disciplines and specialties, discussion focuses on the common-ground of methodological issues. The group brings a depth of experience and breadth of knowledge about theoretical sources that consistently offers each presenter a fresh set of ideas and references to improve their own work.

Within each discipline, we often raise new questions, unaware that research in another discipline may have already addressed the same basic issues. The interdisciplinary critique of the Fellows Seminar improves participant's research by moving projects more quickly through the conceptual terrain that may have played a significant role in the history of other intellectual traditions. What is "new" in one discipline may be "old hat" in another.

The different perspectives of the participants and their ability to pose new questions often gives the presenter, whether faculty or graduate student, a fresh perspective on their own materials. Even when writers chose not to address the concerns of other disciplines, they develop a greater awareness of their own discplinary assumptions and the role they play in shaping their individual project.
