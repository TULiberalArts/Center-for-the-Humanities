Faculty Fellowships provide teaching relief and research support for tenured and tenure-track faculty pursuing research in the humanities or humanistic social sciences. Fellows receive a one-course teaching reduction during the year and $1000 for research expenses. Recipients participate in the bi-weekly Fellows Seminar, where all members present part of their work-in-progress for critique to a lively interdisciplinary group of faculty and doctoral students. Fellows also present their research as a public lecture during the year.

All tenured and tenure-track faculty working on research projects in the humanities or humanistic social sciences are eligible. Recipients must be able to attend and participate in person in the bi-weekly CHAT Fellows Seminar in order to remain eligible for the award.

- A research statement (2-3 pages) describing the project proposed for the fellowship year. Provide an overview articulating the central ideas, problems, or questions examined by the project.
- A current C.V.

### Fellowship Coordination
Applicants for the Graduate School Senior Doctoral Fellowship or CLA Advanced Graduate Scholar Award who do not receive an award can be considered for the Graduate Associate Fellowship on request, using the same application. _You do not need to submit a second application._

## Fellows Seminar
All CHAT Fellows participate in bi-weekly meetings to discuss the work-in-progress of the participants. Lunch is provided, and material is pre-circulated so that discussion focuses on responses to the work.

All faculty and graduate students holding fellowships or associateships participate in a bi-weekly set of meetings to discuss the work-in-progress of the participants. Lunch is provided, and material is pre-circulated so that discussion focuses on responses to the work.

Because participants come from a wide variety of disciplines and specialties, discussion focuses on the common-ground of methodological issues. The group brings a depth of experience and breadth of knowledge about theoretical sources that consistently offers each presenter a fresh set of ideas and references to improve their own work.

Within each discipline, we often raise new questions, unaware that research in another discipline may have already addressed the same basic issues. The interdisciplinary critique of the Fellows Seminar improves participant's research by moving projects more quickly through the conceptual terrain that may have played a significant role in the history of other intellectual traditions. What is "new" in one discipline may be "old hat" in another.

The different perspectives of the participants and their ability to pose new questions often gives the presenter, whether faculty or graduate student, a fresh perspective on their own materials. Even when writers chose not to address the concerns of other disciplines, they develop a greater awareness of their own discplinary assumptions and the role they play in shaping their individual project.

## CHAT/Temple Libraries Digital Scholars Program
The Digital Scholars Program is a collaboration between the Center for the Humanities at Temple and the Digital Scholarship Center of Temple Libraries. It trains graduate students at Temple to apply digital research methods to humanistic or artistic material for their own research or creative projects. Students also participate in an international online collective and receive a $500 scholarship.

**Deadline for 2019-20 is September 17, 2018**<br>
The Digital Scholars Program is a collaboration between the Center for the Humanities at Temple and the Digital Scholarship Center of Temple Libraries. It trains graduate students at Temple to apply digital research methods to humanistic or artistic material for their own research or creative projects. Participants meet weekly in the Fall for an introduction to digital research techniques. In Spring, students work on their own projects and meet every two weeks. At the end of the year, all participants present their projects to the scholarly community. Students also are eligible to participate in an international online collective and receive a $500 scholarship.

The online program is organized by HASTAC (Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology Alliance and Collaboratory), the leading digital center for faculty, students, and librarians in the digital humanities. For complete information about the [HASTAC website](https://www.hastac.org/about-hastac) to see full program details.

**Eligibility**<br>
Applicants must be an M.A., M.S., M.F.A., or Ph.D. student in good standing at Temple University. Students in all schools, colleges, and departments are encouraged to apply.

**Application**<br>
Please send a three-page statement (1000 words) proposing a digital research or creative project and explaining how you think it will further your work. This can be provisional, but you should touch on each of the following elements:

- What digital material do you want to work with, and where will it come from? You do not need to have it in hand, but you do need to know what kind of data you need (a Twitter feed? Images? Maps? Texts?). Is it accessible?
- What digital tools do you imagine using? Explain if you need an exhibition platform, mapping capability, textual analysis software, and so forth. Think in terms of function rather than specific programs.
- Identify at least one online project similar to what you want to do.

- **[Digital Scholars Program Application](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/sites/liberalarts/files/DigitalScholars19.pdf)**

No previous experience or familiarity with digital research tools is needed, but do explain your relevant skills and background.

Send your statement and C.V. as email attachments to [dsc_fellowships@temple.edu](mailto:dsc_fellowships@temple.edu). Direct any questions about the award to Professor Peter Logan, Digital Scholarship Center Academic Director, [peter.logan@temple.edu](mailto:peter.logan@temple.edu), [215 204-8567](tel:2152048567).
