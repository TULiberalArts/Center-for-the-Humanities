**Humanities Internships for Graduate Students - A Conversation**<br>
Thurdsay, October 11<br>
12:30-1:50, CHAT Lounge<br>

Join us for a conversation about internships. Could they be the first step for careers and research in the public humanities?  What kinds of internships exist? What are employers looking for? How do your skills apply in the workplace? How do you get an internship? 

An experienced graduate intern, internship supervisor, and faculty will open up about how they got their internships, what their experiences were, and how they benefited from the experience.

**_Answers to the Labor Question: The Origins of Industrial Relations Regimes in the Anglophone World, 1880-1945_** 
Thursday, September 13<br>
12:30 - 1:50pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

Starting in the mid-19th Century, elites and reformers often alluded to “the labor question,” which was rooted in the system of wage labor that produced contending classes of employers and employees as industrialization unfolded. The labor question involved both social justice (how workers would be treated as a class) and social order (how class conflict could be managed). Despite many similarities, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K and the U.S. came up with dramatically different answers to the labor question that I label “voluntarist,” “statist,” and “legalist.” Exploring the paths these nations took and those they rejected, this project illuminates how and why they developed divergent industrial relations regimes.

Gary Mucciaroni is a Professor in the Department of Political Science and Director of the Master of Public Policy Program at Temple University. He served as Department Chair from 2005-10 and 2015-16. He is the author of four books and several articles on public policymaking in the United States and specifically on policies related to employment, public assistance, taxes, trade, telecommunications, LGBTQ rights, and abortion.

**_What does it mean to be ‘Post Truth’?_** _co-sponsored with the Global Studies Program_
Wednesday, September 26<br>
4:00 - 5:30pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

The phenomenon of "post-truth" rocketed to public attention in November 2016, when it was named "word of the year" by the Oxford Dictionaries. But what does it mean? Is post-truth synonymous with lying? Where did post-truth come from? And does saying that we are in a post-truth era mean that no one cares about truth anymore? Some have defined post-truth as the idea that "objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief." I'll discuss this and how it fits into the political context of seeing post-truth as a precursor to authoritarian rule.

Lee McIntyre is a Research Fellow at the Center for Philosophy and History of Science at Boston University and a Lecturer in Ethics at Harvard Extension School. He has previously taught philosophy at Colgate University, Boston University, Tufts Experimental College and Simmons College. He is the author of Post-Truth (MIT Press, 2018) and several popular essays that have appeared in _The New York Times, The Chronicle of Higher Education, The New Statesman, and The Times Higher Education Supplement_.

**_How Sound Shapes Demonstrations, and How Demonstrations Shape Sound_**
Thursday, October 18<br>
12:30 - 1:50pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

How does the sound of street protests reflect the kind of democracy that is allowed? What factors shape sonic participation? Starting with Turino's concept of performance as presentational or participatory, I examine the ways in which sociopolitical circumstances, policing (Rancière), urban landscape (Parkinson), and acoustics (Kang) shape protest performance. Drawing from field work, I analyze the sound demonstration, a Japanese protest featuring a truck upon which DJs and rappers perform - a tactic born of the constraints placed by police and the urban environment. American protests are less organized, with scattered protesters spontaneously erupting into sound; this format allows for innovation in chants but also involves social segregation and hierarchy.

Noriko Manabe is Associate Professor of Music Studies at Temple University. Her monograph, _The Revolution Will Not Be Televised: Protest Music After Fukushima_, won the John Whitney Hall Book Prize from the Association for Asian Studies, the British Forum for Ethnomusicology Book Award, and Honorable Mention for the Alan Merriam Prize from the Society for Ethnomusicology. She is currently writing her second monograph, _Revolution Remixed: Intertextuality in Protest Music_, and co-editing the volumes, the Oxford Handbook of Protest Music (with Eric Drott) and Nuclear Music (with Jessica Schwartz). She has recently analyzed Kendrick Lamar and the sounds of post-Trump protests. She is series editor for _33-1/3 Japan_, a book series on Japanese popular music at Bloomsbury Publishing.

**_Believing Against the Evidence_**
Thursday, October 18<br>
12:30 - 1:50pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

We all do things we believe we shouldn’t do. Do we also believe things we believe we shouldn’t believe? For many of us, the very idea of ‘akrasia’ in belief is deeply puzzling. If we discover compelling evidence that one of our beliefs is mistaken, don’t we give up the belief? Isn’t that how changing our minds works? This talk argues that a clearer picture of belief can both dissolve and explain that widespread puzzlement, and help us understand a broad range of phenomena, from self-deception to superstition to anorexia.

Eugene Chislenko is an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Temple University, where he teaches courses in moral philosophy and its history. His recent work includes _"A Solution for Buridan's Ass"_ (Ethics, January 2016) and _"Moore's Paradox and Akratic Belief"_ (Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, May 2016). He is now working on a book manuscript about moral motivation, entitled _The Guise of the Good_, and a series of essays on the ethics of blame.

**_Queering "Civil Disobedience"_**<br>
Thursday, November 1<br>
12:30 –1:50 pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

In a government whose legitimacy depends upon the "consent of the governed," civil disobedience can be understood as withholding one's consent to be governed. Refusing to pay one's taxes, for example, leaves the state with few options other than resorting to force, and exposes the ultimately coercive nature of a government that claims to be free and democratic. Successful acts of civil disobedience cast the protester as the object of the state's aggressive demand for consent-a position that is, despite Henry David Thoreau's insistence on the manliness of civil disobedience, oddly feminized. In addition to Thoreau's essay, I examine Melville's fictional character Bartleby, reading him as a type of the paradoxically defensive, queer version of selfhood that consent theory constructs and the withholding of consent exposes.

Katherine Henry is Associate Professor of English and department chair. Her first book, _Liberalism and the Culture of Security: The Nineteenth-Century Rhetoric of Reform_, considers the strategies antislavery and women's rights activists employed to challenge the boundaries of U.S. citizenship, and her research continues to engage questions of civic participation and liberal political theory as they are represented in literary texts.

**_Reimagining the Agency of Borderland Populations: The Bronze Age Indus and Magan Interaction Sphere and Role of the Site of Dahwa as a Regional Redistribution Center for Foreign Goods._** _Co-sponsored with the Department of Anthropology, the Global Studies Program, and the Department of Geography and Urban Studies_<br>
Wednesday, November 7<br>
4:00 - 5:30pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

The Arabian Gulf has long been a venue for exchange of goods, ideas, and people. This is true today, as it was in the ancient past. The waters that separated the Gulf islands and the Arabian Peninsula from Elam, Baluchistan, and Indus have served as a trade corridor for more than 5,000 years. During the Bronze Age (3200-2000BC), trade focused on copper mined from the mountains of the Oman Peninsula in exchange for ceramics, personal ornaments, and other valued commodities. This talk will explore the role of the site of Dahwa as a regional redistribution center that existed at the nexus of two borderlands: on the coast with access to foreign traders and travelers and at the mouth of a major wadi that connected it to the rest of the Oman Peninsula.

Dr. Nasser al-Jahwari is a landscape archaeologist who earned his PhD from Durham University, UK. He has extensive archaeological field experience and currently directs the field project at the 3rd millennium BC site at Dahwa area near to Saham, Oman. He is an expert on Umm an-Nar settlement patterns on the Oman Peninsula. Most recently, he has published on the importance of Oman’s coastal seaports, settlements strategies, and the distribution of monuments on the Oman Peninsula. He is currently Associate Professor of Archaeology at Sultan Qaboos University in the Sultanate of Oman. He is also a world heritage expert for some international organizations such as ICOMOS and WMF.

**_Creating an American Myth: How the U.S. Census Uses Social Science and Stereotype to Define Race in America_**<br>
Thursday, November 15<br>
12:30 –1:50 pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

How and why does the U.S. Census determine what race is - and should mean - in the United States? The first Census Bureau identified three races: "Free white males/females, all other free persons, and slaves." Over time, dozens of newly discovered "races" have entered - and exited - the Census. In 2016, the Bureau proposed adding a new Census 2020 race category - "MENA". Recently, it abruptly reversed course. This talk situates these evolving race definitions against political, cultural, and legal developments over time, and highlights social-science methodologies that shaped the 2020 Census "race" categories - for perhaps the most important Census of our lifetime.

Hosea H. Harvey is Associate Professor of Law and Political Science (by courtesy) at Temple University. His articles have appeared in an array of publications and have been cited by _The New York Times_ and other media sources. Using both qualitative and empirical methods, he specializes in analyzing the design, implementation, and effectiveness of laws, public policies, and regulations that impact vulnerable populations.

**_Doctors' Orders: The Making of Status Hierarchies in the American Medical Profession_**<br>
Thursday, January 24<br>
12:30 –1:50 pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

Not all doctors, it seems, are created equal. This talk will examine the construction and implications of status hierarchies among internal medicine residents along the lines of educational pedigree. I will explore how American-trained MDs come to enjoy higher status in the profession compared to international or osteopathic graduates, who disproportionately occupy less prestigious positions. I will conclude that by relying on informal status distinctions that equate status with merit and eclipse structural disadvantages, US-trained physicians are able to remain elite despite importing some of the world’s best and brightest.

Tania Jenkins (Ph.D. Brown University) is a sociologist specializing in the medical profession. Her work examines how and why status hierarchies are (re)produced among physicians and how they impact both doctors and patients. Her research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and the International Association of Medical Science Educators, among others. She is currently writing her first book entitled _Doctors’ Orders: The Making of Status and Inequality in the American Medical Profession_ (under contract with Columbia University Press).

**_Polskayiti: Polish Permutations in Haitian Religious History and Culture_**<br>
Thursday, February 7<br>
12:30 - 1:50pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

Polish troops fought in the Haitian Revolution, some defecting in support of rebel slaves. With them was Our Lady of Częstochowa, who remains an adored figure in Haitian religion. They have descendants in Haiti today. Furthermore, a Polish American once ruled the Haitian island of La Gonâve, the Polish pope John Paul II momentously visited Haiti in 1983, while a Polish American prelate is the spiritual godfather of Haitian Miami. Each summer, meanwhile, busloads of Haitian pilgrims visit the Shrine of Częstochowa, in Doylestown. PolskAyiti researches all of this.

Terry Rey is Professor of Religion at Temple University. He works primarily in the fields of the anthropology and the history of African and African diasporic religions.

**_The Known Citizen: Exploring the History of Privacy in Modern America_**<br>
Wednesday, February 13<br>
3:00 –5:30 pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

Every day, Americans make decisions about their privacy: what to share and when, how much to expose and to whom.  Securing the boundary between one’s private affairs and public identity has become a central task of citizenship. Ranging from the era of “instantaneous photography” to our own age of big data, Sarah Igo will explore how privacy became the indispensable language for monitoring the ever-shifting line between our personal and social selves — and the surprising ways that debates over what should be kept out of the public eye transformed U.S. politics and society.

Sarah E. Igo (Ph.D. Princeton University) is an Associate Professor of History and Director of the Program in American Studies at Vanderbilt University. An intellectual and cultural historian of the modern United States, she is the author of _The Averaged American: Surveys, Citizens and the Making of a Mass Public_ (2007) and a new book, _The Known Citizen: A History of Privacy in Modern America_ (2018).

**_Women and the Spectacle of Politics: The Theater in Lima, 1800-1850_**<br>
Thursday, February 21<br>
12:30 - 1:50pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

Modern politics came to being in Peru around the 1800s. Political oratory boomed; struggles for power dominated the early republic. Women did not play a visible role in these manly-dominated spheres. We have to look somewhere else to find them in action. The theater of Lima offered them an arena. Women of the elite and lower groups were regulars. They smoked and raised their voices in protest. Some performed and exercised authority as actresses. A few worked as managers. Women played leading roles in Lima’s theater at a time when this institution was conceived of as the ideal space to build a virtuous republican nation.

Mónica Ricketts is a historian of colonial Latin America and the Iberian Atlantic World. She specializes in the intellectual, political, and cultural history of the Spanish world. She received her B.A. and Licenciate degrees from the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú in Lima, Peru, and her Ph.D. from Harvard University. She has taught at Temple University since 2010. In 2017 she published _Who Should Rule? Men of Arms, the Republic of Letters, and the Fall of the Spanish Empire_ (Oxford University Press). She is currently working on the role of the theater in the formation of a common political culture in Spain and Spanish America and on the history of women’s political participation in Peru.

**_Tabloid Trump and the Political Imaginary, 1980-1999_**<br>
Thursday, March 21<br>
12:30 –1:50 pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

Years before Twitter, Fox News, or reality TV, Donald Trump became a public figure through his presence across a range of tabloid media. Although much of that focused on sex and spectacle, early tabloid coverage of Trump was surprisingly political, with speculation about a possible presidential campaign beginning as early as 1987. Through the theoretical lens of the political imaginary, this talk tracks the early articulation of Trump as political brand, the boundary-crossing media logics that shaped his public persona, and the political work the tabloids performed in building the foundations upon which the actual Trump presidency now stands.

Geoffrey Baym is professor of Media Studies and Production at Temple University. He is the author of _From Cronkite to Colbert: The Evolution of Broadcast News_ (Oxford, 2010) and numerous articles and chapters exploring ongoing transformations in public affairs media, popular discourse, and political culture.

**_Hate and Border Ephemerality in the Digital Realm_**<br> 
_Co-Sponsored with the Global Studies Program and the Klein College of Media and Communication_<br>
Thursday, March 28<br>
4:00 - 5:30pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

Border walls have been in our minds for the last couple of years thanks to President Trump’s promise that he would build one and that Mexico would pay for it. But there are other walls, which in their ephemerality and inconsistency are also at play in the contemporary experience of ethnicity and immigration in the United States. In this talk, Dr. Amaya explores the digital architecture of the internet as it constitutes new forms of intersubjectivity and perplexing displays of ethnic and nationalistic hate that often rely on different gradations of anonymity.

Dr. Hector Amaya is Professor of Media Studies at the University of Virginia and the Infosys Member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. He researches globalization, ethnicity, and Latinas/os. His current project, _The Anonymous Condition_, examines new forms of social interaction afforded by digitation and evaluates them against normative ideas of the public sphere. This will be his fourth single authored book.
