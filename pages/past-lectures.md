**Humanities Internships for Graduate Students - A Conversation**<br>
Thurdsay, October 11<br>
12:30-1:50, CHAT Lounge<br>

Join us for a conversation about internships. Could they be the first step for careers and research in the public humanities?  What kinds of internships exist? What are employers looking for? How do your skills apply in the workplace? How do you get an internship? 

An experienced graduate intern, internship supervisor, and faculty will open up about how they got their internships, what their experiences were, and how they benefited from the experience.

**_Answers to the Labor Question: The Origins of Industrial Relations Regimes in the Anglophone World, 1880-1945_** 
Thursday, September 13<br>
12:30 - 1:50pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

Starting in the mid-19th Century, elites and reformers often alluded to “the labor question,” which was rooted in the system of wage labor that produced contending classes of employers and employees as industrialization unfolded. The labor question involved both social justice (how workers would be treated as a class) and social order (how class conflict could be managed). Despite many similarities, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K and the U.S. came up with dramatically different answers to the labor question that I label “voluntarist,” “statist,” and “legalist.” Exploring the paths these nations took and those they rejected, this project illuminates how and why they developed divergent industrial relations regimes.

Gary Mucciaroni is a Professor in the Department of Political Science and Director of the Master of Public Policy Program at Temple University. He served as Department Chair from 2005-10 and 2015-16.

**_What does it mean to be ‘Post Truth’?_** _co-sponsored with the Global Studies Program_
Wednesday, September 26<br>
4:00 - 5:30pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

The phenomenon of "post-truth" rocketed to public attention in November 2016, when it was named "word of the year" by the Oxford Dictionaries. But what does it mean? Is post-truth synonymous with lying? Where did post-truth come from? And does saying that we are in a post-truth era mean that no one cares about truth anymore? Some have defined post-truth as the idea that "objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief." I'll discuss this and how it fits into the political context of seeing post-truth as a precursor to authoritarian rule.

Lee McIntyre is a Research Fellow at the Center for Philosophy and History of Science at Boston University and a Lecturer in Ethics at Harvard Extension School. He has previously taught philosophy at Colgate University, Boston University, Tufts Experimental College and Simmons College. He is the author of Post-Truth (MIT Press, 2018) and several popular essays that have appeared in _The New York Times, The Chronicle of Higher Education, The New Statesman, and The Times Higher Education Supplement_.

**_How Sound Shapes Demonstrations, and How Demonstrations Shape Sound_**
Thursday, October 18<br>
12:30 - 1:50pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

How does the sound of street protests reflect the kind of democracy that is allowed? What factors shape sonic participation? Starting with Turino's concept of performance as presentational or participatory, I examine the ways in which sociopolitical circumstances, policing (Rancière), urban landscape (Parkinson), and acoustics (Kang) shape protest performance. Drawing from field work, I analyze the sound demonstration, a Japanese protest featuring a truck upon which DJs and rappers perform - a tactic born of the constraints placed by police and the urban environment. American protests are less organized, with scattered protesters spontaneously erupting into sound; this format allows for innovation in chants but also involves social segregation and hierarchy.

Noriko Manabe is Associate Professor of Music Studies at Temple University. Her monograph, _The Revolution Will Not Be Televised: Protest Music After Fukushima_, won the John Whitney Hall Book Prize from the Association for Asian Studies, the British Forum for Ethnomusicology Book Award, and Honorable Mention for the Alan Merriam Prize from the Society for Ethnomusicology. She is currently writing her second monograph, _Revolution Remixed: Intertextuality in Protest Music_, and co-editing the volumes, the Oxford Handbook of Protest Music (with Eric Drott) and Nuclear Music (with Jessica Schwartz). She has recently analyzed Kendrick Lamar and the sounds of post-Trump protests. She is series editor for _33-1/3 Japan_, a book series on Japanese popular music at Bloomsbury Publishing.

**_Believing Against the Evidence_**
Thursday, October 18<br>
12:30 - 1:50pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

We all do things we believe we shouldn’t do. Do we also believe things we believe we shouldn’t believe? For many of us, the very idea of ‘akrasia’ in belief is deeply puzzling. If we discover compelling evidence that one of our beliefs is mistaken, don’t we give up the belief? Isn’t that how changing our minds works? This talk argues that a clearer picture of belief can both dissolve and explain that widespread puzzlement, and help us understand a broad range of phenomena, from self-deception to superstition to anorexia.

Eugene Chislenko is an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Temple University, where he teaches courses in moral philosophy and its history. His recent work includes _"A Solution for Buridan's Ass"_ (Ethics, January 2016) and _"Moore's Paradox and Akratic Belief"_ (Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, May 2016). He is now working on a book manuscript about moral motivation, entitled _The Guise of the Good_, and a series of essays on the ethics of blame.

**_Queering "Civil Disobedience"_**<br>
Thursday, November 1<br>
12:30 –1:50 pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

In a government whose legitimacy depends upon the "consent of the governed," civil disobedience can be understood as withholding one's consent to be governed. Refusing to pay one's taxes, for example, leaves the state with few options other than resorting to force, and exposes the ultimately coercive nature of a government that claims to be free and democratic. Successful acts of civil disobedience cast the protester as the object of the state's aggressive demand for consent-a position that is, despite Henry David Thoreau's insistence on the manliness of civil disobedience, oddly feminized. In addition to Thoreau's essay, I examine Melville's fictional character Bartleby, reading him as a type of the paradoxically defensive, queer version of selfhood that consent theory constructs and the withholding of consent exposes.

Katherine Henry is Associate Professor of English and department chair. Her first book, _Liberalism and the Culture of Security: The Nineteenth-Century Rhetoric of Reform_, considers the strategies antislavery and women's rights activists employed to challenge the boundaries of U.S. citizenship, and her research continues to engage questions of civic participation and liberal political theory as they are represented in literary texts.

**_Reimagining the Agency of Borderland Populations: The Bronze Age Indus and Magan Interaction Sphere and Role of the Site of Dahwa as a Regional Redistribution Center for Foreign Goods._** _Co-sponsored with the Department of Anthropology, the Global Studies Program, and the Department of Geography and Urban Studies_<br>
Wednesday, November 7<br>
4:00 - 5:30pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

The Arabian Gulf has long been a venue for exchange of goods, ideas, and people. This is true today, as it was in the ancient past. The waters that separated the Gulf islands and the Arabian Peninsula from Elam, Baluchistan, and Indus have served as a trade corridor for more than 5,000 years. During the Bronze Age (3200-2000BC), trade focused on copper mined from the mountains of the Oman Peninsula in exchange for ceramics, personal ornaments, and other valued commodities. This talk will explore the role of the site of Dahwa as a regional redistribution center that existed at the nexus of two borderlands: on the coast with access to foreign traders and travelers and at the mouth of a major wadi that connected it to the rest of the Oman Peninsula.

Dr. Nasser al-Jahwari is a landscape archaeologist who earned his PhD from Durham University, UK. He has extensive archaeological field experience and currently directs the field project at the 3rd millennium BC site at Dahwa area near to Saham, Oman. He is an expert on Umm an-Nar settlement patterns on the Oman Peninsula. Most recently, he has published on the importance of Oman’s coastal seaports, settlements strategies, and the distribution of monuments on the Oman Peninsula. He is currently Associate Professor of Archaeology at Sultan Qaboos University in the Sultanate of Oman. He is also a world heritage expert for some international organizations such as ICOMOS and WMF.

**_Creating an American Myth: How the U.S. Census Uses Social Science and Stereotype to Define Race in America_**<br>
Thursday, November 15<br>
12:30 –1:50 pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

How and why does the U.S. Census determine what race is - and should mean - in the United States? The first Census Bureau identified three races: "Free white males/females, all other free persons, and slaves." Over time, dozens of newly discovered "races" have entered - and exited - the Census. In 2016, the Bureau proposed adding a new Census 2020 race category - "MENA". Recently, it abruptly reversed course. This talk situates these evolving race definitions against political, cultural, and legal developments over time, and highlights social-science methodologies that shaped the 2020 Census "race" categories - for perhaps the most important Census of our lifetime.

Hosea H. Harvey is Associate Professor of Law and Political Science (by courtesy) at Temple University. His articles have appeared in an array of publications and have been cited by _The New York Times_ and other media sources. Using both qualitative and empirical methods, he specializes in analyzing the design, implementation, and effectiveness of laws, public policies, and regulations that impact vulnerable populations.
