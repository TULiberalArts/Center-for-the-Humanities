## Faculty Fellowships
Faculty fellowships provide teaching relief and research support for tenured and tenure-track faculty pursuing research in the humanities or humanistic social sciences. Fellows receive a one-course teaching reduction during the year and $1,000 for research expenses. Recipients participate in the bi-weekly Fellows Seminar, where all members present part of their work-in-progress for critique to a lively interdisciplinary group of faculty and doctoral students. Fellows also present their research as a public lecture during the year.

**Eligibility**<br>
Tenured and tenure-track faculty working on research projects in the humanities or humanistic social sciences are eligible. Recipients must be able to attend and participate in person in the bi-weekly CHAT Fellows Seminar in order to remain eligible for the award. Failure to attend the Seminars in person may
result in a loss of the award at the discretion of the CHAT Director. Previous applicants are encouraged to reapply. Previous recipients of the Fellowship may reapply four years after the end of the last fellowship year. Simultaneous application to external fellowships is encouraged.

- **Deadline for 2019-20 Faculty Fellowships is November 9, 2020**<br>

## Interdisciplinary Research Groups
The Center for the Humanities at Temple supports Interdisciplinary Research Groups. These groups may be awarded funding to organize conferences, lectures, and other activities. These groups help Temple faculty from different departments, schools, and colleges to pursue shared research interests as well as participate in consortia with faculty from other universities. 
Proposals that engage emerging fields of inquiry and/or are linked to an interdisciplinary agenda are encouraged. Successful proposals are awarded between $500 and $1500 for use during the academic year of the award, depending on the size of the group and the research agenda. Unused funds will revert back to CHAT by June 30th. Groups receive priority access to CHAT facilities for meetings and lectures.

Groups must have at least two faculty organizers from different departments (at least one of these must be from the College of Liberal Arts) and a minimum of four faculty members from within Temple University. Groups may apply for funding renewal every year. A report of past year’s activities is due to the Director of CHAT by May 1, 2021 or at the time of application for funds for the next academic year.

- **Deadline for 2020-2021 Proposals is April 1, 2020**
