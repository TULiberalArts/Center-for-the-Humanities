## 2018-2019 CHAT Lectures and Workshops

### Distinguished Faculty Lecture Series
All talks showcase new research by Temple faculty on alternate Thursdays, 12:30-1:50 pm, CHAT Lounge, 10th Floor, Gladfelter Hall.

### Borders, Boundaries and Walls Lecture Series
Boundaries, borders, and walls demarcate exclusion, difference, transgression, transcendence. Within the humanities, boundaries, borders, and walls offer a wide range of possibility for exploration, from the disciplinary-theoretical to the personal-political. They can be corporeal or mental; theoretical or material; and new ways of seeing emerge when we transgress boundaries, cross borders, and break through walls. In addition to five lectures by outside scholars from different disciplines, CHAT will convene a conference on borders, boundaries, and walls in the spring of 2019.

### Professional Development Workshops
These workshops are designed for graduate students in the humanities and social sciences and will feature academic and professional specialists from inside Temple University and outside institutions. Topics include fellowship applications, job search, career development, and digital humanities.

## Upcoming Talks

**Tania Jenkins, Sociology**<br>
_Distinguished Lecture Series_<br>
**_Doctors' Orders: The Making of Status Hierarchies in the American Medical Profession_**<br>
Thursday, January 24<br>
12:30 –1:50 pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

Not all doctors, it seems, are created equal. This talk will examine the construction and implications of status hierarchies among internal medicine residents along the lines of educational pedigree. I will explore how American-trained MDs come to enjoy higher status in the profession compared to international or osteopathic graduates, who disproportionately occupy less prestigious positions. I will conclude that by relying on informal status distinctions that equate status with merit and eclipse structural disadvantages, US-trained physicians are able to remain elite despite importing some of the world’s best and brightest.

Tania Jenkins (Ph.D. Brown University) is a sociologist specializing in the medical profession. Her work examines how and why status hierarchies are (re)produced among physicians and how they impact both doctors and patients. Her research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and the International Association of Medical Science Educators, among others. She is currently writing her first book entitled _Doctors’ Orders: The Making of Status and Inequality in the American Medical Profession_ (under contract with Columbia University Press).

_Distinguished Lecture Series_<br>
**_Polskayiti: Polish Permutations in Haitian Religious History and Culture_**<br>
Thursday, February 7<br>
12:30 - 1:50pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

Polish troops fought in the Haitian Revolution, some defecting in support of rebel slaves. With them was Our Lady of Częstochowa, who remains an adored figure in Haitian religion. They have descendants in Haiti today. Furthermore, a Polish American once ruled the Haitian island of La Gonâve, the Polish pope John Paul II momentously visited Haiti in 1983, while a Polish American prelate is the spiritual godfather of Haitian Miami. Each summer, meanwhile, busloads of Haitian pilgrims visit the Shrine of Częstochowa, in Doylestown. PolskAyiti researches all of this.

Terry Rey is Professor of Religion at Temple University. He works primarily in the fields of the anthropology and the history of African and African diasporic religions.

**Sarah Igo, History Department, Vanderbilt University**<br>
_Boundaries Lecture Series_<br>
**_The Known Citizen: Exploring the History of Privacy in Modern America_**<br>
Wednesday, February 13<br>
4:00 –5:30 pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

Every day, Americans make decisions about their privacy: what to share and when, how much to expose and to whom.  Securing the boundary between one’s private affairs and public identity has become a central task of citizenship. Ranging from the era of “instantaneous photography” to our own age of big data, Sarah Igo will explore how privacy became the indispensable language for monitoring the ever-shifting line between our personal and social selves — and the surprising ways that debates over what should be kept out of the public eye transformed U.S. politics and society.

Sarah E. Igo (Ph.D. Princeton University) is an Associate Professor of History and Director of the Program in American Studies at Vanderbilt University. An intellectual and cultural historian of the modern United States, she is the author of _The Averaged American: Surveys, Citizens and the Making of a Mass Public_ (2007) and a new book, _The Known Citizen: A History of Privacy in Modern America_ (2018).

**Mónica Ricketts, History**<br>
_Distinguished Lecture Series_<br>
**_Women and the Spectacle of Politics: The Theater in Lima, 1800-1850_**<br>
Thursday, February 21<br>
12:30 - 1:50pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

Modern politics came to being in Peru around the 1800s. Political oratory boomed; struggles for power dominated the early republic. Women did not play a visible role in these manly-dominated spheres. We have to look somewhere else to find them in action. The theater of Lima offered them an arena. Women of the elite and lower groups were regulars. They smoked and raised their voices in protest. Some performed and exercised authority as actresses. A few worked as managers. Women played leading roles in Lima’s theater at a time when this institution was conceived of as the ideal space to build a virtuous republican nation.

Mónica Ricketts is a historian of colonial Latin America and the Iberian Atlantic World. She specializes in the intellectual, political, and cultural history of the Spanish world. She received her B.A. and Licenciate degrees from the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú in Lima, Peru, and her Ph.D. from Harvard University. She has taught at Temple University since 2010. In 2017 she published _Who Should Rule? Men of Arms, the Republic of Letters, and the Fall of the Spanish Empire_ (Oxford University Press). She is currently working on the role of the theater in the formation of a common political culture in Spain and Spanish America and on the history of women’s political participation in Peru.
