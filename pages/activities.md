## 2018-2019 CHAT Lectures and Workshops

### Distinguished Faculty Lecture Series
All talks showcase new research by Temple faculty on alternate Thursdays, 12:30-1:50 pm, CHAT Lounge, 10th Floor, Gladfelter Hall.

### Borders, Boundaries and Walls Lecture Series
Boundaries, borders, and walls demarcate exclusion, difference, transgression, transcendence. Within the humanities, boundaries, borders, and walls offer a wide range of possibility for exploration, from the disciplinary-theoretical to the personal-political. They can be corporeal or mental; theoretical or material; and new ways of seeing emerge when we transgress boundaries, cross borders, and break through walls. In addition to five lectures by outside scholars from different disciplines, CHAT will convene a conference on borders, boundaries, and walls in the spring of 2019.

### Professional Development Workshops
These workshops are designed for graduate students in the humanities and social sciences and will feature academic and professional specialists from inside Temple University and outside institutions. Topics include fellowship applications, job search, career development, and digital humanities.

## Upcoming Talks

![Hector Amaya]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resizedhectoramaya3.jpg){:.responsive-img .img-right}
**Hector Amaya, Media Studies, University of Virginia**<br>
_Boundaries Lecture Series_<br>
**_Hate and Border Ephemerality in the Digital Realm_**<br> 
_Co-Sponsored with the Global Studies Program and the Klein College of Media and Communication_<br>
Thursday, March 28<br>
4:00 - 5:30pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

Border walls have been in our minds for the last couple of years thanks to President Trump’s promise that he would build one and that Mexico would pay for it. But there are other walls, which in their ephemerality and inconsistency are also at play in the contemporary experience of ethnicity and immigration in the United States. In this talk, Dr. Amaya explores the digital architecture of the internet as it constitutes new forms of intersubjectivity and perplexing displays of ethnic and nationalistic hate that often rely on different gradations of anonymity.

Dr. Hector Amaya is Professor of Media Studies at the University of Virginia and the Infosys Member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. He researches globalization, ethnicity, and Latinas/os. His current project, _The Anonymous Condition_, examines new forms of social interaction afforded by digitation and evaluates them against normative ideas of the public sphere. This will be his fourth single authored book.

**_CHAT Graduate Fellows Conference_**<br>
**Investigating Borders and Boundaries of the Body**<br>
Friday, April 5<br>
12-4:30pm, CHAT Lounge, Gladfelter Hall, 10th Floor<br>

Expanding this year’s CHAT theme of Borders, Boundaries, and Walls, the 2019 symposium aims to explore the experience of the body-as-boundary from a variety of perspectives. Boundaries delimit what is possible and yet simultaneously invite and sometimes even encourage transgression and transcendence. How do bodies shape knowledge and emotion? What possibilities emerge when we consider the social experience of the body as both limit and possibility; closed and porous?

**Keynote Speaker:** Dr. Janet Lyon, Associate Professor of English, Penn State University<br>
**_Epistemologies of Bodyminds: Disability and Modernism_**<br>

The CHAT Fellows Conference is from 12-4:30pm on Friday, April 5, 2019 with the following schedule:<br>
- 12 - 12:15 PM - Opening Remarks
- 12:15 - 1 PM - Lunch
- 1 - 2:30 PM - Keynote Address: Dr. Janet Lyon, English Department, Penn State University, Epistemologies of Bodyminds: Disability and Modernism
- 2:30 - 3 PM - Coffee Break
- 3 - 4:15 PM - Graduate Student Roundtable
- 4:15 - 4:30 PM - Concluding Remarks

The CHAT Graduate Fellows strive to welcome all attendees and to host an accessible event. If you require specific accommodations, please email [ejwv@temple.edu](mailto:ejwv@temple.edu) by Monday, April 1.

**Borders, Boundaries, Walls Symposium**<br>
_Co-sponsored by Office of International Affairs, Ben Gurion University, College of Liberal Arts, Center for the Humanities at Temple, Feinstein Center for Jewish Studies, Klein College of Media and Communication, Global Studies Program, School of Social Work and Center for the Study of Force and Diplomacy_<br>
Thursday, April 11, 2019, 12:30 - 5:45 pm & Friday, April 12, 9-5 pm<br>
Russell F. Weigley Room, 914 Gladfelter Hall<br>

**Keynote Address:** James Loeffler, Jay Berkowitz Professor of Jewish History, University of Virginia<br>
**_World Without Borders? The Political Geography of Human Rights, 1918-2018_**

The theme of borders, boundaries, and walls is fraught with baggage in the current global political climate, yet the discussions about how to keep people and goods in or out have long been a subject of serious academic inquiry. Temple University is partnering with Ben Gurion University to bring together U.S. and Israeli scholars for an academic conference on the subject. The two-day symposium hopes to cut through the current inflammatory rhetoric to discuss how and why borders, boundaries, and walls (symbolic or real) have been established, how they have been transgressed and transcended, and what the consequences of those transgressions and transcendences are.  By closely examining borders and boundaries, the conference organizers hope to build bridges and foster dialogue across cultural and political divides; and ultimately enhance our understanding of global movements of people, goods, and ideas.

**Topics include:**<br>
- Internal Borders
- Boundaries of Space and Time
- Envisioned and Embodied boundaries
- Gender Boundaries
- Real and Imagined Walls
- Cultural Boundaries
