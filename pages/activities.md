## 2018-2019 CHAT Lectures and Workshops

### Distinguished Faculty Lecture Series
All talks showcase new research by Temple faculty on alternate Thursdays, 12:30-1:50 pm, CHAT Lounge, 10th Floor, Gladfelter Hall.

### Borders, Boundaries and Walls Lecture Series
Boundaries, borders, and walls demarcate exclusion, difference, transgression, transcendence. Within the humanities, boundaries, borders, and walls offer a wide range of possibility for exploration, from the disciplinary-theoretical to the personal-political. They can be corporeal or mental; theoretical or material; and new ways of seeing emerge when we transgress boundaries, cross borders, and break through walls. In addition to five lectures by outside scholars from different disciplines, CHAT will convene a conference on borders, boundaries, and walls in the spring of 2019.

### Professional Development Workshops
These workshops are designed for graduate students in the humanities and social sciences and will feature academic and professional specialists from inside Temple University and outside institutions. Topics include fellowship applications, job search, career development, and digital humanities.

The panel discussion will be an opportunity to hear from four Council of Library and Information Resources postdoctoral fellows located at research universities and liberal art colleges around the country. Each CLIR fellow will talk about their doctoral research and their postdoctoral career path, before we turn to a discussion followed by Q&A focused on professionalization in academia, the changing nature of doctoral study, and the opportunities available for graduates to find fulfilling and meaningful employment in the current era.

**Geoffrey Baym, Department of Media Studies and Production**<br>
_Distinguished Lecture Series_<br>
**_Tabloid Trump and the Political Imaginary, 1980-1999_**<br>
Thursday, March 21<br>
12:30 –1:50 pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

Years before Twitter, Fox News, or reality TV, Donald Trump became a public figure through his presence across a range of tabloid media. Although much of that focused on sex and spectacle, early tabloid coverage of Trump was surprisingly political, with speculation about a possible presidential campaign beginning as early as 1987. Through the theoretical lens of the political imaginary, this talk tracks the early articulation of Trump as political brand, the boundary-crossing media logics that shaped his public persona, and the political work the tabloids performed in building the foundations upon which the actual Trump presidency now stands.

Geoffrey Baym is professor of Media Studies and Production at Temple University. He is the author of _From Cronkite to Colbert: The Evolution of Broadcast News_ (Oxford, 2010) and numerous articles and chapters exploring ongoing transformations in public affairs media, popular discourse, and political culture.

**Hector Amaya, Media Studies, University of Virginia**<br>
_Boundaries Lecture Series_<br>
**_Hate and Border Ephemerality in the Digital Realm_**<br> 
_Co-Sponsored with the Global Studies Program_<br>
Thursday, March 28<br>
4:00 - 5:30pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

Border walls have been in our minds for the last couple of years thanks to President Trump’s promise that he would build one and that Mexico would pay for it. But there are other walls, which in their ephemerality and inconsistency are also at play in the contemporary experience of ethnicity and immigration in the United States. In this talk, Dr. Amaya explores the digital architecture of the internet as it constitutes new forms of intersubjectivity and perplexing displays of ethnic and nationalistic hate that often rely on different gradations of anonymity.

Dr. Hector Amaya is Professor of Media Studies at the University of Virginia and the Infosys Member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. He researches globalization, ethnicity, and Latinas/os. His current project, _The Anonymous Condition_, examines new forms of social interaction afforded by digitation and evaluates them against normative ideas of the public sphere. This will be his fourth single authored book.

**_CHAT Graduate Fellow’s Symposium_**<br>
**"Investigating Borders and Boundaries of the Body"**<br>
Friday April 5th, 2019<br>
11:00am-4:00pm<br>
CHAT Lounge, Gladfelter Hall, 10th Floor<br>

Expanding this year’s CHAT theme of Borders, Boundaries, and Walls, the 2019 symposium aims to explore the experience of the body-as-boundary from a variety of perspectives. Boundaries delimit what is possible and yet simultaneously invite and sometimes even encourage transgression and transcendence. How do bodies shape knowledge and emotion? What possibilities emerge when we consider the social experience of the body as both limit and possibility; closed and porous?

- **Keynote Speaker:** Dr. Janet Lyon, Associate Professor of English, Penn State University
- Detailed schedule coming soon.
