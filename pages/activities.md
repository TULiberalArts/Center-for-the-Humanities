## 2018-2019 CHAT Lectures and Workshops

### Distinguished Faculty Lecture Series
All talks showcase new research by Temple faculty on alternate Thursdays, 12:30-1:50 pm, CHAT Lounge, 10th Floor, Gladfelter Hall.

### Borders, Boundaries and Walls Lecture Series
Boundaries, borders, and walls demarcate exclusion, difference, transgression, transcendence. Within the humanities, boundaries, borders, and walls offer a wide range of possibility for exploration, from the disciplinary-theoretical to the personal-political. They can be corporeal or mental; theoretical or material; and new ways of seeing emerge when we transgress boundaries, cross borders, and break through walls. In addition to five lectures by outside scholars from different disciplines, CHAT will convene a conference on borders, boundaries, and walls in the spring of 2019.

### Professional Development Workshops
These workshops are designed for graduate students in the humanities and social sciences and will feature academic and professional specialists from inside Temple University and outside institutions. Topics include fellowship applications, job search, career development, and digital humanities.

## Upcoming Talks
**_Professional Development Workshop_**

**Humanities Internships for Graduate Students - A Conversation**<br>
Thurdsay, October 11<br>
12:30-1:50, CHAT Lounge<br>

Join us for a conversation about internships. Could they be the first step for careers and research in the public humanities?  What kinds of internships exist? What are employers looking for? How do your skills apply in the workplace? How do you get an internship? 

An experienced graduate intern, internship supervisor, and faculty will open up about how they got their internships, what their experiences were, and how they benefited from the experience.

- **Jonathan Burton** is the Executive Director of the Philadelphia Society for the Preservation of Landmarks. In this role, he has overseen interns from a wide variety of backgrounds, who have worked in development, communications, education, curatorial, and other roles at the organization.

- **Joy Feagan** obtained her first internship by cold-calling her local historical society to ask if they'd like some extra help. Thankfully, they did. Since then Joy has interned and worked at historical societies, libraries, and museums including the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History, Mote Marine Aquarium's Arthur Vining Davis Library, and the Tampa Baseball Museum.

- **Hilary Iris Lowe** is an assistant professor in the History Department. She has served as the faculty internship advisor for graduate and undergraduate students at Temple. Her own graduate internship introduced her to the work of public humanities.

### _Distinguished Lecture Series_**

**Eugene Chislenko, Philosophy**<br>
**_Believing Against the Evidence_**
Thursday, October 18<br>
12:30 - 1:50pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

We all do things we believe we shouldn’t do. Do we also believe things we believe we shouldn’t believe? For many of us, the very idea of ‘akrasia’ in belief is deeply puzzling. If we discover compelling evidence that one of our beliefs is mistaken, don’t we give up the belief? Isn’t that how changing our minds works? This talk argues that a clearer picture of belief can both dissolve and explain that widespread puzzlement, and help us understand a broad range of phenomena, from self-deception to superstition to anorexia.

Eugene Chislenko is an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Temple University, where he teaches courses in moral philosophy and its history. His recent work includes "A Solution for Buridan's Ass" (Ethics, January 2016) and "Moore's Paradox and Akratic Belief" (Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, May 2016). He is now working on a book manuscript about moral motivation, entitled _The Guise of the Good_, and a series of essays on the ethics of blame.

**Katherine Henry, English**<br>
**_Queering "Civil Disobedience"_**<br>
Thursday, November 1<br>
12:30 –1:50 pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

In a government whose legitimacy depends upon the "consent of the governed," civil disobedience can be understood as withholding one's consent to be governed. Refusing to pay one's taxes, for example, leaves the state with few options other than resorting to force, and exposes the ultimately coercive nature of a government that claims to be free and democratic. Successful acts of civil disobedience cast the protester as the object of the state's aggressive demand for consent-a position that is, despite Henry David Thoreau's insistence on the manliness of civil disobedience, oddly feminized. In addition to Thoreau's essay, I examine Melville's fictional character Bartleby, reading him as a type of the paradoxically defensive, queer version of selfhood that consent theory constructs and the withholding of consent exposes.

Katherine Henry is Associate Professor of English and department chair. Her first book, _Liberalism and the Culture of Security: The Nineteenth-Century Rhetoric of Reform_, considers the strategies antislavery and women's rights activists employed to challenge the boundaries of U.S. citizenship, and her research continues to engage questions of civic participation and liberal political theory as they are represented in literary texts.

**Tania Jenkins, Sociology**<br>
**_Doctors' Orders: The Making of Status Hierarchies in the American Medical Profession_**<br>
Thursday, January 24<br>
12:30 –1:50 pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

Not all doctors, it seems, are created equal. This talk will examine the construction and implications of status hierarchies among internal medicine residents along the lines of educational pedigree. I will explore how American-trained MDs come to enjoy higher status in the profession compared to international or osteopathic graduates, who disproportionately occupy less prestigious positions. I will conclude that by relying on informal status distinctions that equate status with merit and eclipse structural disadvantages, US-trained physicians are able to remain elite despite importing some of the world’s best and brightest.

Tania Jenkins (Ph.D. Brown University) is a sociologist specializing in the medical profession. Her work examines how and why status hierarchies are (re)produced among physicians and how they impact both doctors and patients. Her research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and the International Association of Medical Science Educators, among others. She is currently writing her first book entitled _Doctors’ Orders: The Making of Status and Inequality in the American Medical Profession_ (under contract with Columbia University Press).
