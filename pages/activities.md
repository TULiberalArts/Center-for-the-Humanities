## 2018-2019 CHAT Lectures and Workshops

### Distinguished Faculty Lecture Series
All talks showcase new research by Temple faculty on alternate Thursdays, 12:30-1:50 pm, CHAT Lounge, 10th Floor, Gladfelter Hall.

### Borders, Boundaries and Walls Lecture Series
Boundaries, borders, and walls demarcate exclusion, difference, transgression, transcendence. Within the humanities, boundaries, borders, and walls offer a wide range of possibility for exploration, from the disciplinary-theoretical to the personal-political. They can be corporeal or mental; theoretical or material; and new ways of seeing emerge when we transgress boundaries, cross borders, and break through walls. In addition to five lectures by outside scholars from different disciplines, CHAT will convene a conference on borders, boundaries, and walls in the spring of 2019.

### Professional Development Workshops
These workshops are designed for graduate students in the humanities and social sciences and will feature academic and professional specialists from inside Temple University and outside institutions. Topics include fellowship applications, job search, career development, and digital humanities.

## Upcoming Talks

![Sarah Igo]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized2 Sarah Igo.jpg){:.responsive-img .img-right}
**Sarah Igo, History Department, Vanderbilt University**<br>
_Boundaries Lecture Series_<br>
**_The Known Citizen: Exploring the History of Privacy in Modern America_**<br>
Wednesday, February 13<br>
3:00 –5:30 pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

Every day, Americans make decisions about their privacy: what to share and when, how much to expose and to whom.  Securing the boundary between one’s private affairs and public identity has become a central task of citizenship. Ranging from the era of “instantaneous photography” to our own age of big data, Sarah Igo will explore how privacy became the indispensable language for monitoring the ever-shifting line between our personal and social selves — and the surprising ways that debates over what should be kept out of the public eye transformed U.S. politics and society.

Sarah E. Igo (Ph.D. Princeton University) is an Associate Professor of History and Director of the Program in American Studies at Vanderbilt University. An intellectual and cultural historian of the modern United States, she is the author of _The Averaged American: Surveys, Citizens and the Making of a Mass Public_ (2007) and a new book, _The Known Citizen: A History of Privacy in Modern America_ (2018).

**_Women and the Spectacle of Politics: The Theater in Lima, 1800-1850_**<br>
Thursday, February 21<br>
12:30 - 1:50pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

Modern politics came to being in Peru around the 1800s. Political oratory boomed; struggles for power dominated the early republic. Women did not play a visible role in these manly-dominated spheres. We have to look somewhere else to find them in action. The theater of Lima offered them an arena. Women of the elite and lower groups were regulars. They smoked and raised their voices in protest. Some performed and exercised authority as actresses. A few worked as managers. Women played leading roles in Lima’s theater at a time when this institution was conceived of as the ideal space to build a virtuous republican nation.

Mónica Ricketts is a historian of colonial Latin America and the Iberian Atlantic World. She specializes in the intellectual, political, and cultural history of the Spanish world. She received her B.A. and Licenciate degrees from the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú in Lima, Peru, and her Ph.D. from Harvard University. She has taught at Temple University since 2010. In 2017 she published _Who Should Rule? Men of Arms, the Republic of Letters, and the Fall of the Spanish Empire_ (Oxford University Press). She is currently working on the role of the theater in the formation of a common political culture in Spain and Spanish America and on the history of women’s political participation in Peru.

**Geoffrey Baym, Department of Media Studies and Production**<br>
_Distinguished Lecture Series_<br>
**_Tabloid Trump and the Political Imaginary, 1980-1999_**<br>
Thursday, March 21<br>
12:30 –1:50 pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

Years before Twitter, Fox News, or reality TV, Donald Trump became a public figure through his presence across a range of tabloid media. Although much of that focused on sex and spectacle, early tabloid coverage of Trump was surprisingly political, with speculation about a possible presidential campaign beginning as early as 1987. Through the theoretical lens of the political imaginary, this talk tracks the early articulation of Trump as political brand, the boundary-crossing media logics that shaped his public persona, and the political work the tabloids performed in building the foundations upon which the actual Trump presidency now stands.

Geoffrey Baym is professor of Media Studies and Production at Temple University. He is the author of _From Cronkite to Colbert: The Evolution of Broadcast News_ (Oxford, 2010) and numerous articles and chapters exploring ongoing transformations in public affairs media, popular discourse, and political culture.

**Hector Amaya, Media Studies, University of Virginia**<br>
_Boundaries Lecture Series_<br>
**_Hate and Border Ephemerality in the Digital Realm_**<br> 
_Co-Sponsored with the Global Studies Program_<br>
Thursday, March 28<br>
4:00 - 5:30pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

Border walls have been in our minds for the last couple of years thanks to President Trump’s promise that he would build one and that Mexico would pay for it. But there are other walls, which in their ephemerality and inconsistency are also at play in the contemporary experience of ethnicity and immigration in the United States. In this talk, Dr. Amaya explores the digital architecture of the internet as it constitutes new forms of intersubjectivity and perplexing displays of ethnic and nationalistic hate that often rely on different gradations of anonymity.

Dr. Hector Amaya is Professor of Media Studies at the University of Virginia and the Infosys Member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. He researches globalization, ethnicity, and Latinas/os. His current project, _The Anonymous Condition_, examines new forms of social interaction afforded by digitation and evaluates them against normative ideas of the public sphere. This will be his fourth single authored book.

**_CHAT Graduate Fellow’s Symposium_**<br>
**"Investigating Borders and Boundaries of the Body"**<br>
Friday April 5th, 2019<br>
11:00am-4:00pm<br>
CHAT Lounge, Gladfelter Hall, 10th Floor<br>

Expanding this year’s CHAT theme of Borders, Boundaries, and Walls, the 2019 symposium aims to explore the experience of the body-as-boundary from a variety of perspectives. Boundaries delimit what is possible and yet simultaneously invite and sometimes even encourage transgression and transcendence. How do bodies shape knowledge and emotion? What possibilities emerge when we consider the social experience of the body as both limit and possibility; closed and porous?

- **Keynote Speaker:** Dr. Janet Lyon, Associate Professor of English, Penn State University
- Detailed schedule coming soon.
