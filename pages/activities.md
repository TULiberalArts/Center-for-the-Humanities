## 2018-2019 CHAT Lectures and Workshops

### Distinguished Faculty Lecture Series
All talks showcase new research by Temple faculty on alternate Thursdays, 12:30-1:50 pm, CHAT Lounge, 10th Floor, Gladfelter Hall.

### Borders, Boundaries and Walls Lecture Series
Boundaries, borders, and walls demarcate exclusion, difference, transgression, transcendence. Within the humanities, boundaries, borders, and walls offer a wide range of possibility for exploration, from the disciplinary-theoretical to the personal-political. They can be corporeal or mental; theoretical or material; and new ways of seeing emerge when we transgress boundaries, cross borders, and break through walls. In addition to five lectures by outside scholars from different disciplines, CHAT will convene a conference on borders, boundaries, and walls in the spring of 2019.

### Professional Development Workshops
These workshops are designed for graduate students in the humanities and social sciences and will feature academic and professional specialists from inside Temple University and outside institutions. Topics include fellowship applications, job search, career development, and digital humanities.

The theme of borders, boundaries, and walls is fraught with baggage in the current global political climate, yet the discussions about how to keep people and goods in or out have long been a subject of serious academic inquiry. Temple University is partnering with Ben Gurion University to bring together U.S. and Israeli scholars for an academic conference on the subject. The two-day symposium hopes to cut through the current inflammatory rhetoric to discuss how and why borders, boundaries, and walls (symbolic or real) have been established, how they have been transgressed and transcended, and what the consequences of those transgressions and transcendences are.  By closely examining borders and boundaries, the conference organizers hope to build bridges and foster dialogue across cultural and political divides; and ultimately enhance our understanding of global movements of people, goods, and ideas.

**Benjamin Talton, History**<br>
_Distinguished Lecture Series_<br>
_Co-sponsored with the Global Studies Program_<br>
**_The Afterlife of Radicalism: African Americans and Africa in the Age of Reagan_**<br>
Thursday, April 18<br>
12:30 - 1:50pm, CHAT Lounge<br>

During the 1980s, African American elected officials adopted US support for the white-minority government in South Africa as their consensus foreign policy issue and gained an outsized voice in US foreign affairs. In this talk, Professor Talton examines the defining features of African American involvement in African affairs from within the US government during the 1980s and the reasons this high point of political engagement with the continent ended during the 1990s. 

Benjamin Talton is a historian of modern African history at Temple University. His book, _In This Land of Plenty: Mickey Leland and Africa in American Politics_, is forthcoming from Penn Press.
