### Art History

**Women Artists in the Americas since 1950**<br>
**ARTH 8460, [Professor Mariola Alvarez](https://tyler.temple.edu/faculty/mariola-alvarez-phd), Tr 4:30-7:00 pm**<br>
This course addresses art made by women artists across the Americas since the 1950s, including painting, performance, video, and photography. We discuss how women have forged experimental practices; reconceived ideas of the body, gender roles, and labor; and produced art as a form of political resistance against oppression, censorship, and sexism. Students analyze artworks through writings by women artists, social and political history, and gender, queer, and race theory. Each student will be expected to lead a class discussion and write a research paper on a topic relevant to the class.

### Geography and Urban Studies

**Race, Class, and Gender in Cities**<br>
**GUS 5097, [Professor R. Sanders](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/sanders-rickie), Tr 5:30 pm - 8:00 pm**<br>
The course is designed to acquaint you with dominant frameworks for understanding the social and spatial organization of cities and the symbiotic relationship between space and unequal power hierarchies. We explore analytical frameworks such as critical race theory, political economy, and feminist theory. Next, we apply integrated frameworks to contemporary metropolitan processes and problems, e.g. immigration, contemporary social movements, economic restructuring, criminalization/prisons. An important part of the course is a consideration of the effectiveness of the dominant frameworks in informing our understanding of contemporary concerns with intersectionality and praxis. There will be opportunities to draw connections with cities elsewhere.

### Criminal Justice

**CJ 8202, [Professor Jamie Fader](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/fader-jamie), W 2:00 pm - 4:30 pm**<br>
Analyzes the theory, practices and policies of the American correctional system, covering the nature and administration of both institutional and community sanctions and agencies. Students explore competing penal theories and review evidence on the effectiveness of correctional practices. The course investigates the historical development and evolution of imprisonment, trends in the use of confinement, and the effects of incarceration on offenders, families and communities. Students analyze the characteristics of correctional populations and debate the causes and implications of race, class and gender differences. The course identifies significant current issues and reviews ethical, legal and practical dimensions of proposals for reform.

**Simulation Modeling**<br>
**CJ 8222, [Professor Elizabeth Groff](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/groff-elizabeth), T 3:00 pm - 5:30 pm**<br>
This course focuses on agent-based modeling (ABM). ABM enables the creation of theoretically informed representations of dynamic, complex systems in a virtual world. The goal of ABM is to explore how individual-level decisions and interactions translate into collective behavior across groups and geographies. ABM can be used to conduct virtual experiments with the goal of strengthening theories and developing better empirical research designs. The course provides an introduction to using ABM and how to use it in conjunction with empirical research. Students will gain experience developing conceptual models and exposure to programming simple agent-based models.

**Special Topics in Criminal Justice: Surveillance, Security, and Society**<br>
**CJ 8310, [Professor Aunshul Rege](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/rege-aunshul), W 4:45 pm – 7:15 pm**<br>
This course familiarizes students with important technological, social and cultural changes about information, communication, machines, work, consumption, governance, time and space. It examines relationships between the real and virtual, and how this relationship poses important questions about identity, order, citizenship, community, the body and privacy. We will examine a number of issues: (a) new surveillance trends affecting citizens, works, consumers, popular culture, community, crime and social control, war and society, health, sex and the body; (b) the simulation of surveillance in future telemetic societies; and (c) resistance strategies to the contemporary culture of surveillance.

### Music Studies

**Music in the 20th Century: Queer Country**<br>
**MUST 8756, [Professor Shana Goldin-Perschbacher](https://www.temple.edu/boyer/about/people/Goldin-Perschbacher.asp), T 5:00 pm - 7:20 pm**<br>
In this graduate seminar we'll read most of Marx's major writings (including Capital, The German Ideology, and the 18th Brumaire) and also Weber's major writings on religion, power, legitimacy and bureaucracy. The course should be of interest to any graduate student in the social sciences or humanities who wants to read Marx and Weber on their own terms rather than have their knowledge of these authors heavily mediated through secondary sources. Marx and Weber still have major influence on how we do social science and humanistic studies and how we conceive of our world.

### English

**Advanced Study in Genre: Film Noir Adaptation**<br>
**ENG 8304, [Professor Lawrence Venuti](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/venuti-lawrence), T 4:00-6:30 pm**<br>
This course will explore the range of problems--theoretical and formal, cultural and ideological--raised by film adaptation. The focus will be adaptations of prose fiction with emphasis on the genre known as noir or the thriller. We will consider the theory of adaptation in both film and translation studies, treating noir as a film genre and as a form of naturalistic narrative. The aim is to conceptualize film adaptation as a relatively autonomous interpretation shaped by film form and cultural conjuncture. Authors and directors include Antonioni, Cain, Campion, Caspary, Cortázar, Highsmith, McEwan, Malle, Schrader, Winding Refn, Wenders, and Zola.

### Sociology

**Logic of Inquiry**<br>
**SOC 8111, [Professor Gretchen Condran](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/condran-gretchen), Tr 2:00 pm - 4:30 pm**<br>
This course is an introduction to the logic and methods of social research. We will examine the issues that arise in doing and evaluating both quantitative and qualitative research by reading the sociological literature. We will spend some time on the simple tools, e.g. tables and graphs, needed to summarize research results. However the focus will be on larger issues, namely, how researchers draw conclusions from empirical data, and how we can assess the validity of the conclusions they reach.

**Qualitative Methods**<br>
**SOC 8221, [Professor Judith Levine](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/levine-judith), M 2:00 pm - 4:30 pm**<br>
This course introduces the assumptions, theories and practices of qualitative research methods. The course is designed to provide opportunities for developing specific qualitative research skills while gaining familiarity with theories, issues, and problems in qualitative research.

**Race & Ethnicity**<br>
**SOC 8331, [Professor Pablo Vila](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/vila-pablo), T 5:00 pm - 7:30 pm**<br>
This course focuses on the nature of racism, discrimination, prejudice, racial conflict, and racial oppression in American society. Special emphasis will be given to the relationship between race, gender, nationality, immigration status and social class.
- [pvila@temple.edu](mailto:pvila@temple.edu)

**Sexuality & Gender**<br>
**SOC 8401, [Professor Tom Waidzunas](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/waidzunas-tom), Tr 5:00 pm - 7:30 pm**<br>
This is a research intensive course in which we will examine the historical and sociological structures underlying relationships of sexuality and gender. The perspective of the course is that sexuality is a social creation with meaning to be found in culture. Sexuality is learned through socialization and resocialization. This learning takes place within a gendered social system and so sexuality itself is gendered in our culture. We will examine a number of theoretical perspectives and read the major sociological work in the field. The course will be divided into a reading seminar during the first half of each class and research presentations by students in the second half. During the course of the semester each student will each work on a topic of her choosing and will present her progress to class periodically.

**Theories of Globalization**<br>
**SOC 9141,[Professor Lu Zhang](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/zhang-lu), W 5:00 pm - 7:30 pm**<br>
This course provides a broad introduction to the major theories, approaches, issues and debates in the studies of globalization. Globalization has redefined not only the way we understand society at the very basic level but also our own sense of place and identity in a world where we are connected to and influenced by events and people in far off places. Substantively, this course will focus on the relationships between local and global social, economic, political, and cultural processes across time and space. Our scope will be global and historical-comparative, and our approach will be sociological and interdisciplinary.

### Spanish and Portuguese

**Literature and Revolution: Experimental Latin American and Lusophone Literature, 1922-Present**<br>
**SPAN 5141, [Professor Adam Joseph Shellhorse](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/shellhorse-adam-joseph), MWF 11:00-11:50 pm**<br>
This seminar endeavors to think the problem of revolution, media, affect, the arts, and literature in Hispanism, Latin Americanism, and beyond. We will examine what is literature from the perspective of culture, and the concrete functions that have been historically assigned to it: that is, literature's intimate relation to revolution in all its diverse forms, its uneven relation to modernity, race, gender, culture, the subaltern poor, and the nation-state. We will explore a wide array of aesthetic artifacts, including literary texts and films, from Juan José Saer to Alejandra Pizarnik, Roberto Bolaño, and José Saramago. Taught in Spanish and English.
