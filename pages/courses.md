### Anthropology

**Uneasy Pieces: Censorship and Controversy in Modern Art**<br>
**ANTH 8006, [Professor Paul Farnsworth](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/farnsworth-paul), T 5:30 pm – 8:00 pm**<br>
This seminar examines the methods and theories used in archaeological research and provides examples of human history that have been revealed by archaeological research. Topics covered include the historical development of archaeology, the nature of archaeological evidence, measuring and organizing time, analyzing spatial relationships, interpreting material culture, explanations in archaeology, hunter-gatherers in prehistory, agricultural origins, origins of complex societies, historical archaeology, and current trends in archaeology.

### Criminal Justice

**Crime Mapping**<br>
**CJ 8232, [Professor Jerry Ratcliffe](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/ratcliffe-jerry), M 4:45 pm – 7:15 pm**<br>
This course offers an introduction to the spatial analysis of criminal justice data using geographic information systems software (GIS). Each week features classroom and computer lab time. The **class time** gets you up to speed on the theory and ideas. The **lab time** involves making a new map each week, giving you practical experience from the first class. We will cover use of GIS, data handling, creating maps from raw data in Excel, cartography and map design, some spatial statistics to understand what’s going on, and hotspot mapping.

**Seminar in Criminal Justice Policy: Comparative Criminal Justice Around the World**<br>
**CJ 8320, [Professor Rely Vicica](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/v-lcic-e-rely), R 3:00 pm – 5:30 pm**<br>
The United States is known for its “exceptionalism” in crime and justice policy. This course adopts a global, comparative approach to the understanding of key critical issues of crime and justice around the world. We will begin by discussing cross-national variation in crime and global trends, and theories that may explain them. We will then examine the world’s major philosophies of law and justice—i.e., legal traditions. The course will then analyze critical aspects in the operation of major criminal justice institutions (law enforcement/policing; courts/adjudication; and correctional system/penalization). Lastly, we will address issues of international human rights and the role of international criminal tribunals (courts).

### Economics

**Special Topics in Economics**<br>
**ECON 5190, [Professor John Sorrentino](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/sorrentino-john), T 5:30 pm – 8:00 pm**<br>
This course will concentrate on applying the tools of economics to the natural environment. The economics tools revolve around the functioning of markets, externalities, public goods, ecosystem goods and services valuation (market and non-market) and benefit-cost analysis. The applications involve non-renewable versus renewable energy and other resources, pollution and environmental degradation, and “sustainable” scenarios for the future. Examples of particular problems addressed are sustainable food supply, fresh water availability, urbanization of the global population, greenhouse gasses/global warming, and environmental/social justice. Math/Stat tools will be used when appropriate. Assessment will be in the form of class participation, short (open book) quizzes, a research paper and a final exam.

### English

**Advanced Study in Genre: Hybrid Texts and Visual Storytelling**<br>
**ENGL 8304, [Professor Miles Orvell](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/orvell-miles), W 3:00 - 5:30 pm**<br>
o	The word and the image are usually thought of in terms of their separate and differing modes of communication, but the tradition of hybrid texts--combining pictures and language--has attracted increasing theoretical interest in the last 25 years, based on the work of W.J.T. Mitchell and others. Mitchell's concept of the "imagetext" opens up an understanding not only of hybrid forms but of forms we might have imagined to be purely textual or simply visual. The hybridity of mixed forms and the testing of generic boundaries can be found in countless examples. This course will focus on developing a typology of hybrid texts and visual storytelling, with readings in Mitchell, Barthes, James Elkins, Jonathan Crary and others. We will begin by establishing a common set of primary examples along with a core understanding of "picture theory," with brief student presentations in class and written responses; in the last third of the course, students will be able to focus on their own research across a variety of periods, genres, and traditions, culminating in a research paper.

### Gender, Sexuality and Women's Studies

**Introduction to Feminist and LGBTQ Studies**<br>
**GSWS 8001, [Professor Laura Levitt](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/levitt-laura), T 5:30 pm – 8:00 pm**<br>
This course offers an advanced introduction to students interested in the interdisciplinary field of Gender, Sexuality and Women's Studies as well as in applying feminist and queer methods of research, analysis and practice in their own disciplines. This is a rigorous graduate course designed for PhD and MA students especially geared to those pursuing the graduate certificate in Gender, Sexuality and Women’s Studies.

### Geography and Urban Studies

**Special Topic Seminar: Black Geographies**<br>
**GUS 5000, [Professor Celeste Winston](mailto:celeste.winston@temple.edu), M 5:30 PM – 8:00 pm**<br>
This course explores the theoretical and methodological advances made by the interdisciplinary field of Black Geographies. Texts and discussions will highlight how erasures, exclusions, and exploitations of Black people have structured historical and current world conditions. The course will draw lessons from Black knowledges, radical struggles, and everyday life practices as a guide for scholarship and action aimed toward reshaping a new, more just world.

### History

**Introduction to American History I (to 1865) **<br>
**HIST 8101, [Professor Jessica Roney](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/roney-jessica), T 2:00 pm – 4:30 pm**<br>
This is the first segment of the Introduction to American History readings seminar required of all M.A. and Ph.D. students in U.S. History. Doctoral students are required to take both courses in this sequence. M.A. students must take one of the two segments. This segment covers the colonial era through the Civil War.

**Studies in American Diplomatic History**<br>
**HIST 8103, [Professor Alan McPherson](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/mcpherson-alan), T 5:00 pm – 7:30 pm**<br>
Readings in and discussion of the principal schools of interpretation and conceptual frameworks in the history of U.S. foreign relations as a means to introduce students to the subfield. A complement to Studies in the Cold War (HIST 8209), the chronological parameters extend from the Revolutionary era through the conclusion of World War II. In addition to completing weekly reading and writing assignments, and as a final assignment a comparative review essay, students will participate actively in class conversations about history and historians.

**Managing History**<br>
**HIST 8152, [Professor Seth Bruggeman](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/bruggeman-seth), W 2:00 pm – 4:30 pm**<br>
This course explores the practical considerations and theoretical issues concerning the management/ownership of the interpretation, preservation, and presentation of history for public consumption. Emphasis is placed on public management policies and methods of private ownership of critical historical issues, including, but not limited to, museum exhibits, historical preservation policies and practices, governance of historical societies and museums, publication practices, historical documentaries (aural and visual), and other elements related to the dissemination of historical interpretations, common historical knowledge, and public memory. 

**Archives and Manuscripts**<br>
**HIST 8153, [Professor Margery Sly](mailto:msly@temple.edu), W 5:00 pm – 7:20 pm**<br>
An introduction to the theoretical and applied aspects of historical records management. Taught in cooperation with local archives and historical societies.

**HIST 8714, [Professor Eileen Ryan](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/ryan-eileen), R 2:00 pm – 4:30 pm**<br>
This seminar is an introduction to the practice of professional history and to historical methodologies. One of the main purposes of the seminar is to familiarize its participants with the methodological and historiographical evolution of professional history. How has the approach of historians to their craft changed in the last century? What assumptions informed the decisions they have been made about how to study the past? In short, we study methodology because it is a way of approaching the questions that are central to historical scholarship: How do we know what has happened? How do we decide what matters? How do we best study the past? Whose version of history is authoritative?

**Topics in History I**<br>
**HIST 8800, [Professor Katherina Motyl](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/motyl-katya), M 5:00 pm – 7:30 pm**<br>
Introduction to a variety of historical and normally comparative topics and themes in, such as environmental or psychological history.

**Seminar in International History**<br>
**HIST 9208, [Professor Harvey Neptune](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/neptune-harvey-r), R 5:00 pm – 7:30 pm**<br>
This research seminar explores a range of subjects in international history, with particular emphasis on 20th century diplomatic and military history. Research topics are not restricted to any geographic area. Students prepare an oral presentation and research paper on a specific subject of his/her choosing but approved by the instructor. The research utilizes some secondary but principally primary sources.

### Music Studies

**Hip Hop in Global Perspective: Aesthetics, Culture, and Politics of Genre**<br>
**MUST 9702, [Professor Noriko Manabe](https://www.temple.edu/boyer/about/people/Manabe.asp), W 5:00 pm – 7:20pm**<br>
As a genre that grew out of practices from Jamaican toasting and dance clubs, developed through unexpected use of technologies, and spread throughout the world, hip hop offers an interesting case study in the formation and adaptation of genres. Moreover, hip hop is highly referential, making for an excellent case study in intertextuality, cultural memory, and canonization processes. It has also been highly politicized (and often not). This course explores these and other aspects of hip hop: its cultural sources, histories, interaction with language and music, intertextuality, the aesthetics of rap and track-making, globalization, role in social movements, and identity construction in terms of race, class, and nation. In addition to discussing an interdisciplinary array of literature, we will be engaging in close analyses of rap and hip hop tracks.

### Philosophy

**Philosophy of the Mind**<br>
**PHIL 5244, [Professor Gerald Vision](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/vision-gerald), TR 2:00 pm – 3:20 pm**<br>
The course covers topics in the Philosophy of Mind and Cognitive Science, such as the nature of mental states and minds, mental content and meaning, consciousness, conceptions of  self, mental causation, the status of mental properties such as belief and desire, the relation of mental to brain states and to computers and artificial intelligence, mentality in a predominately physical world, and free will. The main text will be an anthology, _Readings in the Philosophy of Mind_ by David Chalmers. In addition to various exams, students will be expected to write a term paper on a topic chosen from our study.

### Political Science

**Political Statistics I**<br>

Introductory applied social statistics. Topics covered include descriptive measures, elementary probability theory, hypothesis testing, and correlation and regression analysis. This course explores inductive statistics including: probability and sampling, multivariate contingency tables, analysis of variance, correlation and regression analysis.

**Qualitative Research Methods**<br>
**POLS 8002, [Professor Sean Yom](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/yom-sean-l), W 5:40 pm – 8:10 pm**<br>
This graduate seminar imparts a general overview of qualitative research methods used in the empirical subfields of political science.  By “qualitative,” this course means methodological techniques that are neither primarily quantitative nor experimental in nature, including case studies, process-tracing, cross-case comparisons, thick description, ethnography, interpretivist critiques, and other strategies of inference.

**Public Opinion & Propaganda**<br>
**POLS 8124, [Professor Kevin Arceneaux](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/arceneaux-kevin), T 3:00 pm – 5:30 pm**<br>

This course offers an in-depth assessment of the state. It begins with the definitional question and explores different approaches to the state. We will then proceed to historical analysis of the rise of states in Europe and other world regions. The third component of the course explores the relationship between states and societies, focusing on cases from both Europe and other world regions. Finally, the course explores the extent of variation in state capacity around the world, and its implications for other areas of investigation in comparative politics. Readings range from theoretical social science to empirical work on a variety of specific cases, and from classics in the field to new work and non-academic accounts of particular countries and regions. The course will build toward the production of a significant research paper.

**International Politics**<br>
**POLS 8301, [Professor Mark Pollack](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/pollack-mark), R 3:30 pm – 6:00 pm**<br>
A graduate-level introduction to theories of international politics, ranging from classical realism and liberalism through contemporary neorealist, institutionalist, constructivist and other approaches.

### Religion

**Philosophy of Religion**<br>
**REL 5001, [Professor Aryeh Botwinick](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/botwinick-aryeh), TBA**<br>
This course adopts a novel approach for making sense of the texts of Western monotheism and uncovering new patterns of relationship to Eastern religion. Within monotheism itself, it focuses upon the relationship between monotheism and skepticism considered both as structures of argument and as ethical contents. Aside from canonical passages in the monotheistic scriptures and in Eastern religion, we will delve into arguments by the following theologians and philosophers:  Plato, St. Augustine, St. Anselm of Canterbury, Moses Maimonides, St. Thomas Aquinas, Nicholas of Cusa, Ibn Senna, Nietzsche, and Wittgenstein.

This course examines contemporary Islam in global context. It covers worldwide Islamic networks and transnational Muslim identities, linking Africa with Asia and the Middle East or Europe with the Americas and Canada. As 21st century realities challenge age-old traditions, Islam and Muslims will be discussed for how they shape and are shaped by local and wide-ranging political, economic, and cultural processes. We will explore Muslims in western contexts with special attention on the United States, examining issues such as the Muslim ban, sharia laws, mosque construction, veiling, racial profiling, Islamophobia and social justice struggles.

**Special Topics in Religion: Death and Dying in Early Christianity**<br>
**REL 8800, [Professor Vasiliki Limberis](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/limberis-vasiliki-m), M 9:00 am – 11:30 am**<br>
Through abundant literary, visual, and archeological evidence, this class will explore what death and dying meant in Early Christianity, 100-500 CE, in the context of Roman culture. We shall include examples of Greco-Roman religions and Jewish evidence as well.

### Sociology

**Logic of Inquiry**<br>
**SOC 8011, [Professor James Bachmeier](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/bachmeier-james), M 5:00 pm – 7:30 pm**<br>
This course is an introduction to the logic and methods of social research. We will examine the issues that arise in doing and evaluating both quantitative and qualitative research by reading the sociological literature. We will spend some time on the simple tools, e.g. tables and graphs, needed to summarize research results. However, the focus will be on larger issues, namely, how researchers draw conclusions from empirical data, and how we can assess the validity of the conclusions they reach. 

**Social Inequality**<br>
**SOC 8381, [Professor Judith Levine](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/levine-judith), M 2:00 pm – 4:30 pm**<br>
This course reviews theories and research regarding the dimensions of inequality and the processes which create, increase, and decrease inequality. It also examines the issues of the relationships between the dimensions of inequality and the processes of cumulative advantage and disadvantage. Individuals, groups, areas, and other social contexts are typically organized hierarchically, and the course explores the ways in which these different social levels shape and are shaped by social inequality over the life course. Examples of these processes include social multiplier effects, "winner take all" theories, the "Matthew Effect" in science, and the "Peter Principle." 

**Medical Sociology**<br>
**SOC 8391, [Professor TBA](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/byng-michelle), T 5:00 pm – 7:30 pm**<br>
This course examines the historical changes in the ideas of health and disease and in society's response to illness. An important component of the course will be to examine the influences of social/political environment on morbidity and mortality in the United States and how population sub-groups experience illness in the medical system. 

**Gender & Body**<br>
**SOC 8411, [Professor Tom Waidzunas](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/waidzunas-tom), R 5:00 pm – 7:30 pm**<br>
This course examines various discourses of the human body including medical, cultural, scientific, and legal discourses. Through a gendered lens the course examines the meaning of human embodiment and its impact on individual and group identities. 

### Spanish

**(Un)Bordering Latinx Studies**<br>
**SPAN 8147, [Professor Rebeca L. Hey-Colón](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/hey-col-n-rebeca-l), W 5:30 pm – 8:00 pm**<br>
This graduate seminar will discuss the various ways in which borders and bordering (understood by García-Peña as the way in which borders affect human beings) manifest and have evolved in the realm of Latinx Studies. Through a discussion of key literary, cultural, and theoretical texts that will touch on notions of history, migration, gender, race, and more, students will gain an appreciation of the ways in which “the border” has evolved from a tangible, physical space/line into a place of contention, confusion, and possibility.
