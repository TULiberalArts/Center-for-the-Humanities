### Art History

**Uneasy Pieces: Censorship and Controversy in Modern Art**<br>
**ARTH 8460, [Professor Gerald Silk](https://tyler.temple.edu/faculty/gerald-silk-phd), W 3:00-5:30 pm**<br>
The course focuses on works, subjects, and artists related to censorship and controversy. We investigate what makes artists/pieces problematic, examining concepts such as iconoclasm, obscenity, "publicness," cultural appropriation, and pornography, and address issues of religion, race, sexuality, identity, nationalism, politics, animal rights, ethics, consent, and chronicling and intervention. The class combines lecture, discussion, readings, presentations, and papers. We screen films, invite outside speakers, and culminate in a trip to the Philadelphia Museum of Art to discuss provocative art first-hand. The class generates passionate and robust discussion as we work together probing the balance between offensive expression and freedom of speech.

### Religion

**Foundations in Judaism**<br>
**REL 5401, [Professor Mark Leuchter](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/leuchter-mark), TR 2:00 pm - 3:20 pm**<br>
This course provides a survey of the social, political, religious and ideological history of the emergence of Judaism in antiquity, spanning roughly a 1000 year period (from 500 BCE to 500 CE). Students will become familiar with the primary texts that bear witness to these developments and the lasting effects of these events and ideas on the formation of Judaism and Christianity in subsequent periods. The course will further identify the process by which myths of cultural and religious origins that still function within contemporary Judaisms and Christianities derive from a selective arrangement and prioritizing of earlier experiences, and how this process is consistent with similar practices in antiquity.

**Foundations in Islam**<br>
**REL 5601, [Professor Khalid Blankinship](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/blankinship-khalid-y), M 9:00 pm - 11:30 pm**<br>
Provides a basic survey of Islam for non-specialists. Includes a historical overview focusing on the relationship of Islam to the world and to other religions and ideologies of ancient, medieval, and modern times. Also considers the major modalities of Islam as a religion, including the legal, spiritual, philosophical, and social aspects. Finally, current issues in Islam will be considered, including modern changes in social organization and present-day politics. No prerequisites or language requirements.

**Foundations in Digital Humanities**<br>
**REL 5801, [Professor Marcus Bingenheimer](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/bingenheimer-marcus), T 5:00 pm - 8:30 pm**<br>
Foundations in Digital Humanities for the Study of Religion will familiarize graduate students with methods and applications from the emerging field of DH. This course alerts students to the digital difference in three fields: text, space, and networks. It focuses on examples from the domain of religious studies, but the methods are applicable in other fields as well.

**Religions in African Diaspora**<br>
**REL 8702, [Professor Terry Rey](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/rey-terry), W 2:00 pm – 4:30 pm**<br>
This course explores the historical development and the social, cultural, and political contours of African-derived or African inspired religions of the Americas. Particular emphasis will be placed on the Candomble in Brazil, Lukumii (Santeria) and Palo in Cuba, Rastafari in Jamaica, Vodou in Haiti. The course also carefully considers communities practicing these and related religious traditions in the United States and the African influences on American religious and artistic cultures.

### Music Studies

**Seminar in Stylistic Analysis: Surrealism**<br>
**CJ 8202, [Professor Matthew Greenbaum](https://www.temple.edu/boyer/about/people/matthewgreenbaum.asp), T 5:00 pm – 7:20 pm**<br>
Surrealism is more than the painting of strange images: works like Satie's Parade (1916) are characteristic of a little-known musical Surrealism found in the works of Stravinsky, Poulenc, Milhaud, and many others. Curiously, 17th-century Mannerism works featured all the characteristics of Surrealism in both art and music, especially in the daring and uncanny works of Gesualdo; much of the semester will be a comparison of these two very different musical epochs. Besides looking at works of Stravinsky and other well-known figures in a new way, you'll explore many little-known, and provocative, and even weird art works and personalities. No musical background is necessary.

### English

**Literacy and Composition Theory**<br>
**ENG 8304**<br>
This course introduces students to primary texts in literacy and writing studies. We will work through articles and books that consider both the history of written language and the social/economic factors that make literacy such a fascinating area of research. In the last weeks, we'll apply what we've learned to a question that should appeal to any intellectual interested in the future of the humanities: How can literacy studies lead to a multidisciplinary concept of "English" or "Communications"? Assignments will include on-line posts, a literacy narrative of 5-8 pages, and a final paper developed out of each student's disciplinary concerns.

### Sociology

**Sociology of Education**<br>
**SOC 8311, [Professor Kimberly Ann Goyette](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/goyette-kimberly), M 5:00 – 7:30 pm**<br>
The main focus of this course is on the ways educational systems both maintain and challenge social inequality. Students discuss the ways education differentially allocates resources based on race, class, gender and other ascriptive characteristics. The class explores issues in both "classical readings" in the Sociology of Education, and also in recent books by those working in the field. This course advances students' own research projects through frequent discussions and evaluations of students' work by the instructor and their peers.

**Contemporary Sociological Theory**<br>
**SOC 9111, [Professor Dustin Kidd](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/kidd-dustin), Tr 2:00 pm – 4:30 pm**<br>
This course surveys a broad range of theoretical perspectives from the 20th and 21st centuries. The course compares these theories in terms of how they contribute to on-going sociological research around a number of social problems.
- [dkidd@temple.edu](mailto:dkidd@temple.edu)

**Qualitative Data Analysis**<br>
**SOC 9241, [Michelle Byng](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/byng-michelle), T 2:00 pm – 4:30 pm**<br>
The central goal of this course is to have students complete a qualitative research project. It focuses on how to collect data, how to organize data for analysis, and how to use the data to answer a research question and/or develop concepts that might inform future research. Toward this end, the course begins with readings about the qualitative research process. The readings detail the agenda(s), logic, and epistemological foundation of qualitative research.

### Philosophy

**Feminist Epistemology and Philosophy of Science**<br>
**PHIL 5217, [Professor Miriam Solomon](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/solomon-miriam), Tr 4:30 pm – 8:00 pm**<br>
This course explores the effects of gender on knowledge in general and science in particular. Feminist critiques since the 1970s challenge traditional claims that knowledge and science are completely objective and unbiased. Unlike relativist approaches, feminist critiques often provide new, more nuanced accounts of objectivity (sometimes called "strong objectivity"). We will examine a range of feminist accounts (e.g. feminist standpoint, feminist postmodern and feminist empiricist) and look at cases from a wide range of sciences. The complex relations between gender, race, class and nationality will also be discussed in relation to these issues.

### Art Education & Community Arts Practices

**Contemporary Issues in Art Education**<br>
**AE 8001, [Professor Renee Jackson](https://tyler.temple.edu/faculty/renee-jackson), M 4:30 pm – 7:00 pm**<br>
This course offers an in-depth exploration of the issues affecting the field of art education. The course examines the efficacy of art education in a complex society (race, class, ethnicity, religion, gender, mass media, special needs, etc.) and seeks to further our understanding of relationships between how/why we teach art and what students learn about art, themselves and the social context. We use simple technological tools to reflect and express ideas and opinions related to the issues, and apply arts based processes to explore issues in depth.

**Interdisciplinary Seminar in Community Arts Practices**<br>
**AE 8011, [Professor Pepon Osorio](https://tyler.temple.edu/faculty/pepon-osorio), MW 4:30 pm – 7:00 pm/TR 11:00 am – 12:20 pm**<br>
Community Arts Practices brings together artists and urban strategists from a range of disciplines with people of a community of location, origin, or tradition, to create arts projects based in the life of that community. The course engages students in practices including: Collaborative Artmaking as a means of community organizing; Arts projects addressing underlying dynamics of equity, self-determination and cultural histories. Come join us as we create site-specific installations, civic dialogue and public history processes with Philadelphia communities. Bring your passions for social justice, urban histories and futures, and your own arts and liberal arts interests.

### History

**Digital History**<br>
**HIST 5152, [Professor Deborah Jean Boyer](mailto:tuf08705@temple.edu), Tr 5:30 pm – 8:00 pm**<br>
The definition of digital history is amorphous, broad, and often debated. Digital history projects may refer to everything from an online exhibition to a podcast to mapping and geographic information systems. This class will explore digital history in terms of the questions of narrative, shared authority, access, and historical analysis that arise when using digital tools for working with history. We will discuss the major issues involved in digital history initiatives and gain familiarity with various technologies often used in such projects.
- [tuf08705@temple.edu](mailto:tuf08705@temple.edu)

**Studies in American Material Culture**<br>
**HIST 8151, [Professor Hilary Lowe](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/iris-lowe-hilary), M 2:00 pm – 4:30 pm**<br>
Introduction to literature from several fields that use artifacts to understand culture. Exploration of various theoretical approaches. Topics include architecture, folk art, photography, decorative arts, landscape design, historic preservation, and the use of interior space.
- [hilowe@temple.edu](mailto:hilowe@temple.edu)

**Studies in Recent American Urban History**<br>
**HIST 8206, [Professor Bryant Simon](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/simon-bryant), , M 5:00 pm – 7:30 pm**<br>
This course is broadly interdisciplinary, concerned with major developments in Ameria's large cities from the mid-nineteenth century to the present. Basic issues include: the changing spatial structure of the city, social and geographical mobility, the nature of ethnicity and the Black experience, the development of crime and rioting, the structure of local politics, and the movements for urban reform.
- [brysimon@temple.edu](mailto:brysimon@temple.edu)

**United States Foreign Policy in the Cold War**<br>
**HIST 8209, [Professor Alan McPherson](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/mcpherson-alan), M 5:00 pm – 7:30 pm**<br>
Few if any "moments" within America's historical experience have generated the intensely competitive and emotionally-charged debates as has the "moment" called the "Cold War." The purpose of this course is to identify the questions that have bedeviled historians of the Cold War, and by reading competing interpretations, evaluate the strategies by which they have been addressed. Sample topics: U.S.-Russian (Soviet) relations, the nuclear arms competition and arms control, regional rivalries, summitry, alliance politics, cultural instruments of influence, crisis management, intelligence agencies, and critical personalities. Students will read widely, write frequently, and speak extensively.
