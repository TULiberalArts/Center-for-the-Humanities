## The Council of Library and Information Resources
![CHAT]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized CHAT.png){:.responsive-img .img-right}
The CLIR awards several postdoctoral fellowships each year to recent Ph.D. graduates in the humanities. These fellowships are designed to foster greater connections between fellows’ research, library collections, and new digital opportunities. Our spring **Professional Development Workshop** brings together four CLIR fellows from research universities and liberal arts colleges across the country, alongside founding co-dean of the Postdoctoral Fellowship Program, **Dr. Elliott Shore**, for a conversation about the opportunities provided by CLIR fellowships. The panel will discuss individual projects as well as the changing nature of the academic market. Please join us Tuesday for “CLIR Opportunities: Balancing Academic and Alt-Ac Career Paths for Doctoral Students.

## Center for the Humanities at Temple
The Center for the Humanities at Temple (CHAT) fosters innovative research and teaching by faculty and students in the humanities and humanistic social sciences at Temple. Located in the middle of a vibrant urban campus, CHAT facilitates interdisciplinary exchange and debate among scholars from different departments and colleges who bring different perspectives to shared intellectual interests. Faculty and students in all schools and colleges at Temple are eligible to participate in the Center's programs. Throughout the year, it offers research grants and fellowships, operates an ongoing research seminar, mounts public lectures and conferences, brings external distinguished scholars to campus, and forges intellectual partnerships with other regional and international universities.
