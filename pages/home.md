## Spring Conference
![CHAT]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized CHAT.png){:.responsive-img .img-right}
In April, our **Borders, Boundaries, and Walls Lecture Series** will be complemented by a conference further exploring the global movement of people, goods, and ideas. The event, co-organized with Ben Gurion University (Negev, Israel) will bring together American, Israeli, and international scholars for a two-day symposium (April 11â€“12) discussing why borders, boundaries, and walls are built, how they are transgressed, and what the consequences of these crossings are. Topics will range from physical manifestations to the symbolic, and include discussion of new disciplinary and theoretical approaches with the hope of fostering a dialogue across existing political and cultural divides. Stay tuned for more information including the full conference program!

If you are interested in presenting a paper at the conference or participating in some other capacity, let us know at [chat@temple.edu](mailto:chat@temple.edu).
