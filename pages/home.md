## Thank you for a Great Semester!
![CHAT]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized CHAT.png){:.responsive-img .img-right}
We at CHAT would like to extend our gratitude to all of you who helped make the fall semester a success. We are excited to share our events planned for the spring. The semester kicks off on January 24th with the next installment in our **Distinguished Faculty Lecture Series**, featuring Professor of Sociology and CHAT fellow Tania Jenkins. Subsequent lectures will highlight the research of Temple professors in the departments of Religion, History, and Media Studies and Production. **Our Boundaries Lecture Series** picks up in February with Vanderbilt University professor of history Sara Igo exploring the shifting boundary between our private and public personas, based on her new book The Known Citizen: Exploring the History of Privacy in Modern America (Harvard University Press, 2018). In addition to our annual Graduate Fellows Conference in March, CHAT will co-host a conference on **Borders, Boundaries, and Walls** in collaboration with Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Israel in April. Look for announcements on the conference programs and other events, including our Professional Development workshops, in the new year. 

Wishing you all the best for the holiday season and new year. We hope to see you in the spring!

## Center for the Humanities at Temple
The Center for the Humanities at Temple (CHAT) fosters innovative research and teaching by faculty and students in the humanities and humanistic social sciences at Temple. Located in the middle of a vibrant urban campus, CHAT facilitates interdisciplinary exchange and debate among scholars from different departments and colleges who bring different perspectives to shared intellectual interests.
