## Trump and Political Branding in the Tabloid Media of the 1980s and 90s
![CHAT]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized CHAT.png){:.responsive-img .img-right}

While the tabloid culture of the 1980s often focused on the spectacle that surrounded him, it also portrayed Trump in a surprisingly political fashion. Professor of Media Studies and Production **Geoffrey Baym** explores how the tabloids helped lay the foundation for Trump’s political persona. Join us Thursday for the next installment of our **Distinguished Faculty Lecture Series:** “Tabloid Trump and the Political Imaginary, 1980-1999.
