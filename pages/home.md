## Center for the Humanities at Temple
The Center for the Humanities at Temple (CHAT) fosters innovative research by faculty and graduate students in the humanities and humanistic social sciences. Faculty and graduate students in all schools and colleges at Temple are eligible to participate in the Centerâ€™s programs. Throughout the year, it offers research grants and fellowships, operates an ongoing research seminar, develops two lecture series, and forges intellectual partnerships with other regional and international universities. CHAT works to bridge the disciplinary divide between departments and colleges by promoting broad, humanities-based conversations that connect scholars from multiple scholarly fields.
