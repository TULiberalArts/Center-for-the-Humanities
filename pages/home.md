**Hundreds of young women...**<br>

Castro Luna is currently serving as the [Poet Laureate](https://temple.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=daac6912a370e1cb9d2c3756a&id=1ddbcbf243&e=0669261260) of Washington State (2018–2020). The talk will be based on her most recent book, the Pushcart nominated Killing Marías, a collection of poetry inspired by the missing women of Juárez.

## A Forum for Scholarship and Intellectual Inquiry in the Humanities
Located on the tenth floor of Gladfelter Hall, the comfortable quarters serve as a gathering place for scholars from across the disciplines to meet, enjoy social hours and read the latest humanities-oriented journals and periodicals. The Center for the Humanities at Temple (CHAT) was established in 2003 to create an interdisciplinary forum for scholarship and intellectual inquiry in the humanities at Temple University. We work to bridge the disciplinary divide between departments and colleges by promoting broad, humanities-based conversations that connect scholars from multiple scholarly fields.

The Center's Director works in concert with an Advisory Board of faculty from different departments in the humanities and social sciences. Participation is open to faculty and students in all schools and colleges at Temple University. CHAT’s operations are funded by the College of Liberal Arts. Additional support is provided by the [Klein College of Media and Communication](https://klein.temple.edu/), [Tyler School of Art](http://www.temple.edu/tyler/), [Boyer College of Music and Dance](http://www.temple.edu/boyer/), and the [Graduate School](http://www.temple.edu/grad/index.htm). CHAT is a member of the [Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes](http://chcinetwork.org/).

The Center offers a rich and diverse range of activities, including:

- Visits of distinguished scholars to campus
- Public lectures and conferences in the humanities for the campus and the community by Temple faculty
- Research grants to faculty and students
- A year-long Fellows Seminar
- Graduate Advanced Fellowship and Associate fellowship programs
- Professional Development workshops for Graduate Students
- Programs to strengthen interdisciplinary graduate and undergraduate studies in the humanities
- Contributions to planning and development across the humanities in the College of Liberal Arts
- Cooperation with national and international humanities institutions
