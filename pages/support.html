## Support for CHAT
**_Charitable gifts from alumni and friends of the Center have a direct effect on the lives of Temple students, strengthening teaching and research and enriching the intellectual life of the humanities and humanistic social sciences at Temple.
100% of your gift goes to programming and fellowship awards, making it easier for students to complete their program of study more quickly and to travel to archives and conferences. Donations help the Center to host conferences and bring international scholars to Temple, to lecture and to meet with students and faculty. Every contribution makes a difference, small or large._**

Contributions are tax-deductible as charitable gifts and are formally acknowledged by the University's Office of Institutional Advancement.
