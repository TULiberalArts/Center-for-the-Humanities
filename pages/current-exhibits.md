Emily Erb's art is an exploration of American identity. The process involves collecting imagery that references American history and culture, collaging it into iconic symbols, tracing the collage onto silk, and painting the silk with dyes. She recently had digital prints made of five of her silk paintings. Collage is a relatively modern technique compared to silk painting which dates back thousands of years. The digital prints are the most technologically advanced version of these images, which deal with current issues in this country, including gun violence, healthcare, and women's rights.

A Richmond, Virginia native, silk painter Emily Erb (b. 1982), has lived and worked in Philadelphia since 2001. In 2005, Erb completed her BFA in painting at the Tyler School of Art and later earned her MFA from the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art in 2012. Although she was first introduced to silk painting while an undergraduate, Erb honed her skills while traveling to Madagascar for three months from 2005-2006; she then switched to painting exclusively on silk. Erb has won numerous awards, including the Mabel Wilson Woodrow Award from the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art.
