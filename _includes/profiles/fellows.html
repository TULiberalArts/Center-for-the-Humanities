<strong><a href="https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/hey-col-n-rebeca-l">Rebeca L. Hey-Colón, Assistant Professor, (Department of Spanish and Portuguese, College of Liberal Arts)</a></strong><br/>

<p>Rebeca L. Hey-Colón is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese at Temple University. Her work establishes connections between the Caribbean diaspora, Chicanx communities, and broader Latinx Studies by analyzing the presence and valence of water.</p>

<p><strong>Project Statement</strong>
As a CHAT Fellow, Hey-Colón will work on her book manuscript <i>Rippling Borders: Women Writing Water in Latina Literature</i>. Taking the sea, our planet’s largest body of water and the one to which all rivers lead, as a point of departure, <i>Rippling Borders</i> brings together various established fields (Atlantic Studies, Border Studies, Caribbean Studies, and Latinx Studies) in a novel way by examining how the spaces of the Río Grande/Río Bravo on the U.S./Mexico border and the Massacre River/Dajabón River on the Haiti/Dominican Republic border are imagined and interpreted by women writers from these regions. Ultimately, <i>Rippling Borders</i> demonstrates how a focus on water and the feminine transcends the physical space of the border while also surfacing connections to transnational histories and epistemologies.</p>

<strong><a href="https://tfma.temple.edu/staff-faculty/kartik-nair">Kartik Nair, Assistant Professor (Department of Film and Media Arts, School of Theater, Film and Media Arts)</a></strong><br/>

<p>Kartik Nair is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Film and Media Arts at Temple University. Dr. Nair's research focuses on the production, regulation, and circulation of horror films in 1980s' India.</p>

<p><strong>Project Statement</strong>
During the 1980s, the Bombay film industry produced a wave of horror movies about bloodsucking witches, deadly curses, and rapacious werewolves. A few prolific producers were behind the wave: they made dozens of films on shoestring budgets by shooting quickly in Bombay’s colonial mansions, working with casts of relatively unknown actors and crews of enthusiastic technicians. The films they made were beloved by young and working-class audiences across India; some, despite playing mostly in second-run theaters and ramshackle video parlors, were major box office hits of the decade. But the films were heavily censored by the Indian government and derided by critics, perceived to be threatening Hindi cinema’s precarious hold on cultural respectability. As the industry transformed into its celebrated contemporary avatar—Bollywood, a global culture industry known for lavish melodramas—the horror wave dissipated, and the films were soon forgotten. This research project brings Bombay’s horror films back into view. By returning to these once-popular, now little-seen films, as well as the aesthetic, legal, and political scandals they caused, the project opposes the widespread gentrification of Indian popular cinema’s history as that of spot-lit stars, elite studios and song-and-dance spectaculars. Instead, I demonstrate what a history of Indian cinema could look like from below by focusing on a subculture of low-budget horror films and revealing the infrastructures of film production, regulation, and exhibition from which they emerged.</p>

<strong><a href="https://tyler.temple.edu/faculty/emily-neumeier">Emily Neumeier, Assistant Professor (Department of Art History, Tyler School of Art and Architecture)</a></strong><br/>

<p>Emily Neumeier is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Art History at Temple University. Her research focuses on the art of the Islamic world, with a specialization in the visual culture and built environment of the eastern Mediterranean.</p>

<p><strong>Project Statement</strong>
One of the most defining characteristics of Istanbul’s urban landscape are the Ottoman mosque complexes that punctuate its iconic skyline. While these buildings were initially constructed in the 16th century, a period that many consider to be the zenith of Ottoman architecture, it is crucial to remember that all of these monuments have been subject to several campaigns of renovation, preservation, and in some cases, complete demolition and reconstruction. My research seeks to uncover the long lives of these monuments, with a particular focus on different moments of architectural restoration.  This project critically examines modern receptions of the past, and, more specifically, how art historical constructions of time—i.e. canonical periods of art and architecture—inform preservation practices. As can be seen in the fierce public debates over how to deal with the destruction of architectural monuments, most recently seen in the case of Notre-Dame cathedral, questions about heritage preservation remain more relevant than ever. I maintain that this kind of long-range view can help us to appreciate the remarkable fluidity of architectural spaces in their capacity as bearers of cultural meaning, from the age of empire to the modern nation-state.</p>

<strong><a href="https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/newman-jess-marie">Jess Marie Newman, Assistant Professor (Department of Anthropology, College of Liberal Arts)</a></strong><br/>

<p>Jess is a feminist medical anthropologist of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Jess’s work combines anthropological studies of bureaucracy and the state with critical medical anthropology, social movement research, and “post”-colonial feminist and queer theory.</p>

<p><strong>Project Statement</strong>
As a CHAT Fellow, I will be finishing my book, which focuses on abortion and single motherhood in the Morocco. The manuscript takes the sentimental politics of “back alley” abortion and the abject-ified single mother as a starting point for untangling why abortion and extramarital sex are such contentious issues. While the sentimental politics of abortion require suffering and dying bodies, single mother advocates emphasize girls who fall victim to sexual assault, incest, and other forms of abuse. Sentimental politics play into Islamophobic imaginaries of despotic misogyny in the MENA. Sentimental politics thus fold easily into neoliberal empowerment projects featuring the well-worn equation: educate, empower, employ, repeat. As a multi-scalar study, Dangerous Sex speaks to the struggles and desires of actors from different social locations. The book centers vulnerable women’s experiences, their daily frustrations and aspirations, even as it follows doctors unsure of how to care for patients, NGO employees restricted by admissions criteria, and activists frustrated by the limits of acceptable speech.</p>

<strong><a href="https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/pollack-mark">Mark Pollack, Professor of Political Science and Law and Jean Monnet Chair (Department of Political Science, College of Liberal Arts)</a></strong><br/>

<p>Mark Pollack is Professor of Political Science and Law and Jean Monnet Chair at Temple University, where he researches and teaches about international law, international institutions, and global governance.</p>

<p><strong>Project Statement</strong>
International courts emerged in the post-Cold War era as key actors in world affairs, with 24 working international courts adopting more than 37,000 judgments. More recently, these same courts have become the subjects of backlash from governments and populist movements around the world. Both political science and legal scholars have studied the behavior and the rulings of international courts, yet these studies tell us little about the <i>lived experience</i> of international justice, including the day-to-day practices of courtroom hearings, deliberation, and drafting of judgments, all of which take place behind the “purple curtain” of judicial secrecy.  Seeing past this curtain requires scholars to look to the disciplines of anthropology and sociology, and to the interpretive method of and ethnographic interviewing.  Building on four years of interviewing judges at four international courts with my Temple Law colleague Jeffrey Dunoff, I will spend my year at CHAT recreating four “cultures” of deliberation and dissent at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and the World Trade Organization’s Appellate Body (AB).</p>
