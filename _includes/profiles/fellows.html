<strong><a href="https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/bachmeier-james">James Bachmeier (Associate Professor, Sociology)</a></strong><br />
<strong>Fellowship - Research Team Fellow</strong><br /></p>

<p>Dr. James D. Bachmeier is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology at Temple University. A sociologist and demographer, Dr. Bachmeier’s research focuses on international migration and patterns of social and economic integration of immigrants in western democracies, especially the United States.</p>

<p><strong>Project Statement</strong>
As a PPL fellow, I am working on developing a new set of demographic estimates of the unauthorized foreign-born population in the United States.  Current research on the quantification of this population is plagued by a paucity of empirical data.  These estimates will rely on publicly available Census survey data and commonly used statistical methods, and this research aims to open new avenues for social science and policy research to produce important knowledge about the size, characteristics, and economic position of the unauthorized immigrant population.  Such research plays a vital role in informing ongoing academic and policy debates about the nation’s immigration dynamics and the future of America’s immigration policy.</p>

<strong><a href="https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/chor-elise">Elise Chor (Assistant Professor, Political Science)</a></strong><br />
<strong>Fellowship - Faculty Fellow</strong><br /></p>

<p>Dr. Elise Chor is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science at Temple University. Dr. Chor’s research draws on economic and developmental perspectives to consider the interactions among families, government, and the early childhood education market.</p>

<p><strong>Project Statement</strong>
Preschool programs targeted towards low-income children can be effective at narrowing vast socioeconomic disparities seen in children’s cognitive, socioemotional, and executive functioning skills at kindergarten entry. Head Start is the targeted public preschool program that serves the greatest number of children in the U.S. with a single program model. Its ability to narrow socioeconomic achievement gaps is limited by wide variation in effectiveness across centers though, which may be explained by variability in per-pupil funding. School finance may have great consequences for preschool – and in particular Head Start – effectiveness as a range of structural and process quality features of the preschool classroom affect children’s development and are expensive to provide. This project investigates the influence of preschool finance policy in one of the first known studies on this subject, measuring the relationships among Head Start per-pupil funding, program quality, and child development. Findings will have implications for enhancing preschool effectiveness for young children through policy and practice in order to promote kindergarten readiness and expand opportunity through adulthood.</p>

<strong><a href="https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/departments/geography-and-urban-studies/dickinson-stephen">Stephen Dickinson (Geography and Urban Studies)</a></strong><br />
<strong>Fellowship - Research Team Fellow</strong><br /></p>

<p>Stephen Dickinson is a PhD Student in the Department of Geography and Urban Studies at Temple University. His research focuses on the effects of urban parks and other open space on marginalized populations, particularly as they relate to neighborhood change.</p>

<p><strong>Project Statement</strong>
Over the past decade, increasing academic and political attention has been paid to the role that greening plays in neighborhood change and displacement in urban environments. In order to attract new residents and increased investment, cities have been paying more attention to their ecosystem services and ensuring that their cities have enough clean parks and other green spaces for their (new) residents to enjoy while touting these features positive impacts on crime rates and health outcomes. Residents in neighborhoods experiencing gentrification have become increasingly wary of efforts by municipal governments, non-profits, and private entities calling for increased numbers and higher quality green spaces. This purpose of this research is to investigate the directionality and drivers of greening and neighborhood change, particularly those of local parks, to determine whether increased greening efforts lead to gentrification or vice versa. Particularly, the study will seek to disentangle urban greening efforts through park development and maintenance from other political, economic, and social drivers of gentrification. I will examine Philadelphia as a site to understand the ways in which greening either is or is not correlated to gentrification because Philadelphia is undergoing a resurgence of investment into parks, while simultaneously dealing with a resurgence of development investment after a long historical period of decline. I will examine the history of park development and maintenance in Philadelphia in order to understand how we might prevent green gentrification moving forward. This fellowship project will serve as preliminary research for my dissertation.</p>

<strong><a href="https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/drabick-deborah">Deb Drabick (Associate Professor, Psychology)</a></strong><br />
<strong>Fellowship - Research Team Fellow</strong><br /></p>

<p>Dr. Deborah A.G. Drabick is an Associate Professor and Director of Graduate Studies in the Department of Psychology at Temple University. Dr. Drabick’s research considers conduct problems among youth using a developmental psychopathology perspective, and includes such areas as risk and resilience, comorbidity, contextual influences, prevention, and intervention.</p>

<p><strong>Project Statement</strong>
Evidence-based practice in psychology, which is the integration of the best available research with clinical expertise in the context of patient characteristics, culture, and preferences, has garnered increased attention in the context of youth mental health interventions. Many interventions have shown efficacy in research settings; however, their effectiveness in community-based settings is mixed and evidence-based practices are infrequently used in community settings. This issue is particularly problematic among low income, urban youth. These youth are at risk for emotional and behavioral difficulties likely stemming from contextual circumstances (e.g., physical and psychosocial stressors, deviant peer groups, violence), which furthermore affect youth’s abilities to regulate emotions, cognitions, and behaviors. Accordingly, early intervention, as well as determining for whom interventions work, is an efficient, cost-effective way of intervening with contextually disadvantaged youth prior to the worsening of psychological symptoms and/or development of additional psychosocial difficulties. Our research project involves providing an adapted preventive intervention for youth behavior problems among fourth grade children who reside in low income, urban environments. Children participate in neurodevelopmental and contextual assessments prior to and after their participation in a group-based, cognitive-behavioral intervention that addresses anger management, problem solving, and coping skills. We collaborate with key stakeholders (e.g., school staff, families) in our implementation of the program. We are invested in disseminating our work in an effective way to inform policy and address calls in the field for translational research, as well as adaptations and improved implementation of evidence-based interventions among underserved, diverse youth.</p>

<strong>Ethan Fried (Political Science)</strong><br />
<strong>Graduate Fellow</strong><br /></p>

<p>Ethan Fried is a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science at Temple University. He specializes in political socialization and civic engagement, and enjoys teaching his students that learning statistics is both totally possible and totally fun.</p>

<p><strong>Project Statement</strong>
My dissertation project focuses on the role that formal civics education plays in the political socialization of adolescents. Although many factors influence how young people learn about politics - including family, media, and geographic environment - the effects of civic education remain an important but understudied part of political science literature. Understanding how civic educators and their classroom environments impact student political knowledge and interest in political and civic activity is of vital importance to scholars and public policymakers who seek to maximize the impact of civics-oriented curricula and imbue future generations with the skills and knowledge necessary for healthy democratic activity. A central part of the project is a survey instrument intended for distribution among Philadelphia School District high school civic educators and their students. This survey investigates the relationship between teacher quality, the learning environment, and key political outcomes for adolescents.</p>

<strong><a href="https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/departments/geography-and-urban-studies/kinsey-dirk">Dirk Kinsey (Geography and Urban Studies)</a></strong><br />
<strong>Graduate Fellow</strong><br /></p>

<p>Dirk Kinsey is a PhD candidate in the Department of Geography and Urban Studies at Temple University. His work is centered on the application of feminist and critical race approaches to understanding urban social and political systems, with a special emphasis on incarceration, health and wellness.</p>

<p><strong>Project Statement</strong>
Dirk’s current research examines the growth of community supervision outside of prison settings, and the institutions, policies and practices that shape these systems. This project seeks to understand the geographies of community supervision in Philadelphia, including the role of community supervision in producing and reinforcing specific spatial configurations at the urban scale and how these spatial configurations are experienced by those under supervision. In addition, this project focuses on health inequities experienced by supervised populations and the specific dimensions of supervision that impact individual and community health.</p>

<strong>Lindsay Myerberg (Psychology)</strong><br />
<strong>Fellowship - Research Team Fellow</strong><br /></p>

<p>Lindsay Myerberg is a PhD candidate in Psychology at Temple University. Her research interests include individual and contextual risk and resilience factors associated with youth adjustment across developmental periods.</p>

<p><strong>Project Statement</strong>
Ms. Myerberg’s project is an empirical evaluation of a manualized cognitive-behavioral intervention, the Coping Power Program, which has proven effective for treating conduct problems among low income, ethnic minority youth, but has received less attention in urban, contextually disadvantaged populations. Coping Power is administered by advanced Clinical Psychology graduate students among fourth grade students at a local elementary school. This 24-session intervention is designed to teach anger management, review non-aggressive ways to interact with others, practice skills to resist peer pressure, learn perspective-taking skills and social problem-solving techniques, and make improvements toward social goals. Neurodevelopmental and psychosocial assessments are conducted before and after the intervention. Analyses will use a variable-centered approach to identify moderators of treatment outcome, as well as a person-centered approach to identify neurodevelopmental profiles and determine whether these profiles may be associated with differential treatment outcomes. Given the public health significance of youth behavior problems as well as the dearth of effective interventions among underserved and contextually disadvantaged groups, improved matching of youth to interventions could facilitate the provision of more efficacious and cost-effective dissemination and implementation of evidence-based practice in the community. Additionally, findings may help to identify types of programs in which policymakers should invest, such as programs for children who are at risk but may not meet diagnostic criteria for a disorder, or school-based aggression prevention programs in low-income, urban communities.</p>

<strong><a href="https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/pearsall-hamil">Hamil Pearsall (Associate Professor, Geography and Urban Studies)</a></strong><br />
<strong>Fellowship - Research Team Fellow</strong><br /></p>

<p>Dr. Hamil Pearsall is an Associate Professor in the Department of Geography and Urban Studies at Temple University. Dr. Pearsall’s research examines the social and environmental justice dimensions of urban sustainability.</p>

<p><strong>Project Statement</strong>
Dr. Pearsall and Stephen Dickinson, PhD student in Geography and Urban Studies, will work together on a Research Team to synthesize the benefits and costs of urban public spaces in North American cities. Urban public space impacts many aspects of a city’s quality of life, including sense of community, social capital, economic and community development, environmental quality, and health. While urban public space has received much attention in scholarly and policy circles, our knowledge of public space requires renewed inquiry. The nature of public space has changed over time with different economic and political dynamics and priorities. There are new models of urban space provision and management that have led towards increasing privatization of public spaces that impacts their provision, accessibility, and use. Additionally, we demand more of our public spaces, expecting them to revitalize neighborhoods, reduce crime, redress longstanding socio-economic and racial inequalities, catalyze economic development, address urban environmental issues like stormwater runoff, and public health concerns like obesity. Our project will focus on two aspects of urban public spaces: 1) the development, management and maintenance of urban public spaces, and 2) approaches to public space evaluation. During the fellowship period we will develop manuscripts for submission to peer-reviewed journals, and our synthesis will contribute to understandings of urban public space by evaluating the state of the field and uncovering key gaps in our knowledge.</p>

<strong><a href="https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/roman-caterina">Caterina Roman (Associate Professor, Criminal Justice)</a></strong><br />
<strong>Fellowship - Faculty Fellow</strong><br /></p>

<p>Dr. Caterina Roman is an Associate Professor in the Department of Criminal Justice at Temple University. Dr. Roman has been interested in applied research in the area of violence prevention and intervention since her undergraduate internship working in a maximum-security prison in Richmond, Virginia.</p>

<p><strong>Project Statement</strong>
Dr. Roman’s Fellowship project is examining the contextual, personal, and social network factors associated with the help-seeking paths of men and women (ages 18-40) from Philadelphia who have been victims of street violence. During the fellowship period, she will extend her work to understand the longer-term criminal justice and health consequences of violent injury among this population, and how the variety of help-seeking paths may be associated with continued offending and the desire for retribution, trauma and more distal health and mental health outcomes. The intent is to produce findings that can help expand the reach of victim and health services and specifically reduce barriers for the underserved.</p>

<strong>Molly Scott (Psychology)</strong><br />
<strong>Fellowship - Graduate Fellow</strong><br /></p>

<p>Molly Scott is a PhD candidate in the Department of Psychology at Temple University. Her research interests include early childhood, vocabulary development, and learning through play.</p>

<p><strong>Project Statement</strong>
Research demonstrates that vocabulary knowledge is essential for children’s academic success. Unfortunately, before children reach formal schooling there is already a significant gap in word knowledge between children from socioeconomically disadvantaged families and their higher SES peers. Despite efforts to redress this gap, previous interventions have made little progress. Researchers have recently suggested that the translation of knowledge from the science of word learning to literacy research may be one way to increase the effectiveness of vocabulary instruction. The current project is a vocabulary intervention for Head Start students that is informed by various principles stemming from the science of word learning. The study will compare this new theoretical approach to the method in which interventions are typically implemented in the classroom.</p>

<strong><a href="https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/smith-david-v">David Smith (Assistant Professor, Psychology)</a></strong><br />
<strong>Fellowship - Faculty Fellow</strong><br /></p>

<p>Dr. David Smith is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology at Temple University. Dr. Smith leads the Neuroeconomics Laboratory where his work is broadly focused on characterizing the neural mechanisms that shape our decisions for social and economic incentives.</p>

<p><strong>Project Statement</strong>
Dr. Smith’s core project within the Public Policy Lab seeks to extend work examining how social decisions change across the lifespan. One of the long-term goals of this line of research is to help older adults make better decisions and avoid financial exploitation. Another goal of this line of research is to understand the mechanisms that predict risk for developing Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD).</p>

<p><img src="/public-policy-lab/media/resizedcodyspence.jpg" alt="Cody Spence" class="responsive-img img-right" />
<strong>Cody Spence (Sociology)</strong><br />
<strong>Fellowship - Research Team Fellow</strong><br /></p>

<p>Cody is a PhD candidate in the Department of Sociology at Temple University. His research interest include immigration and public policy.</p>

<p><strong>Project Statement</strong>
Over the past two decades, in the absence of comprehensive federal immigration reform and during the same time that the undocumented population reached its historic peak in 2007, some states and smaller localities began to assert control over immigration law policing. The shift in authority from federal to state and local levels has led to variation in interior immigration enforcement intensity across the country and over time. My research project aims to evaluate the effects of some of the most punitive state-level immigration policies in two ways. First, I will utilize an innovative statistical technique to estimate the size of undocumented immigrant populations before and after policy implementations. Second, I will assess potential consequences of increased immigration enforcement to federal survey data quality. Understanding the effects of recent shifts in immigration enforcement will be vital as legislators continue debate over federal immigration policy reform.</p>
